INTRODUCTION AND ACKNOWLEDGMENTS 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This manual is dedicated to pilots who take to the air in all types of craft
 driven by wood propellers.
 It represents the basic facts of what is happening in and around the immediate
 surroundings of a wood propeller so that aviators may understand the limits
 of their prop, and take appropriate avoiding action before things go wrong,
 as sometimes happens.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I also dedicate this manual to all the amateur aircraft builders throughout
 S.A.
 with the hope that it will foster safety through education in all aspects
 of our hobby and sport.
 I would like to hear from the aviators true stories regarding wood propellers
 so that it may be published in future editions.
 You could contribute greatly to the advancement of safety concerning propellers.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I have tried to bring all the experience I have learned through trial and
 error, comments and criticism, together so that you, as a pilot, may fly
 safely and securely, having knowledge based on fact and experience 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
available at your finger tips.
 May I suggest that you keep this manual in the same location as your airframe
 logbook, pilot's license, maps etc.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This manual serves as a guideline to the care and maintenance of wood propellers
 and may differ from other publications in various aspects.
 Before any deviation from the prescribed steps is attempted, or difficulty
 in the understanding of the various procedures are encountered, please
 contact the original manufacturer of the propeller for help and guidance.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A propeller is one of the three major components of any aircraft, side by
 side with the airframe and engine.
 pilots worry a lot about load and stress factors, performance, things like
 that, but props and their correct installation and maintenance are vitally
 important to flying safety and enjoyment.

\begin_layout Enumerate
Due to the nature of wood itself, it is necessary that wood propellers and
 blades be frequently inspected to assure continued airworthiness.
 Inspect for such defects as cracks, bruises, scars, warpage, evidence of
 glue failure and separated lamination's, sections broken off and defects
 in the finish.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Irrespective of the make, propellers of wooden construction shall be removed
 and carefully inspected every 1000 hours of operation or 5 years in service,
 whichever is the shorter,

PROLOGUE 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the correct care, attention and maintenance, a wood propeller is capable
 of outlasting its metal or plastic counterpart by a fair amount of years.
 Ever since childhood days I have been mesmerized and enchanted with the
 beautiful smooth curves of a multi-laminated hardwood propeller, sparkling
 with coats of high gloss lacquer.
 As the years went by my interest in anything that could overcome the law
 of gravity grew by leaps and bounds, but unfortunately as one is a youngster
 one has many and varied interests and responsibilities to attend to, before
 one could indulge in the practical art of flying.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This manual has come about through the experience I've had in the last thirty
 or so years of manufacturing propellers for the light aircraft industry.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The questions relating to the manufacturing of propellers had a distinct
 influence on my life and is many and varied and more than, dare I say,
 I am capable of answering straight of the cuff.
 But to every question there is an answer somewhere in this universe, or
 so I thought in 1983.
 The fact of the matter is that very little theory on the design of propellers
 of slow flying aircraft existed at the time, and seems to have advanced
 little since the first amateur aircraft builders known as the Wright brothers
 achieved a startling propulsion efficiency where a possible 65% of the
 shaft power was converted to usable thrust! 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I was still an aspiring carpentry/mathematics/science teacher at a primary
 school at the time when one calm evening a total stranger approached me
 at home with what looked like a piece of wood from a schooner's mast clutched
 tightly under one arm.
 After having introduced himself as Mr.
 "So and So", I was asked to make him a copy of the offensive-looking piece
 of wood, which he, after having seen a puzzled expression on my face, identifie
d as being the remaining wing of a propeller off his microlight aircraft.
 Seeing that I was a carpentry teacher and taking into consideration that
 I could probably throw in a bit of the old applied mathematics and having
 heard rumors that I was somehow remotely connected to flying through a
 friend , I could probably make a better job out of it than he could! 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, I couldn't have been more surprised if someone had suggested that
 I should build the space shuttle to Mars, and that it should be ready for
 flight the very next day! 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was a challenge and I jumped at the chance to try my hand at building
 an integral part of an aircraft.
 Boy, wouldn't that be something to write home about! Imagine, if it worked
 I could rock my grandchildren on the knee and tell them in a gruff voice,
 how their granddad saved aviation from being grounded forever! 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Having relieved the stranger of his weighty piece of wood, I wrote down
 his telephone number and sent him home with the hearty promise of "a new
 propeller tomorrow morning" ringing soothingly in his ears (not to mention
 feeling the noble prize around my neck and hearing a standing ovation as
 I bow in front of an admiring audience of thousands, paying tribute to
 my skills and accomplishments in saving the flying fraternity of the world)
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I immediately set of to my trusty off-cut box and rummaged around looking
 for a suitable specimen of wood to turn into that magical machinery called
 a propeller.
 Minutes later an ideal, sturdy, solid, heavy and strong BURMESE TEAK board
 appeared leaving no doubt in my mind that this is it! A quick eyeball inspectio
n revealed no deformities and seemed of adequate thickness to suite my needs.
 A quick measurement of the original prop's thickness and shaft size was
 taken and the appropriate changes transferred to the board.
 (I was fortunate enough in having had various power-tools at my disposal.)
 Next I made a silhouette of the usable blade and used it as a reference
 for both blades on the new board.
 A couple of nifty cuts with the band saw, revealed a close resemblance
 of the original, boosting hope of finishing the prop by late evening.
 I was dismally mistaken.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A couple of measurements of the height of the leading edge over the trailing
 edge was done and transferred to the new prop by plastic rule and pencil.
 The difficult part was in the cutting and rasping of the excess material
 so that a close resemblance of the original prop slowly emerged stroke
 by stroke.
 By three o'clock in the morning I was at the stage where the prop was fairly
 well balanced, and ready for a coat of varnish.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Early that morning our friend was hammering away at the front door, ready
 as he would ever be to test the creation he had seen laying on the workbench
 through the workshop windows.
 I bearably managed to keep my eyes open while trying to explain to him
 that I would accept no responsibility for the results should anything at
 any time decide to part company with his craft, be it on the ground or
 whilst flying.
 The only answer I received in return was a maniacal grin and a manhandling
 shove in the direction of his bakkie.
 With fear and trepidation I accompanied him to the airfield where in no
 time at all my handiwork was fitted to the engine and running surprisingly
 well, considering the inexperience I had in manufacturing such an item.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The test-flight was a fair success but some minor adjustments had to made
 to correct the vibration.
 I was totally dumbfounded at the sight of seeing something that I had made
 by hand actually transport man and machine into the blue yonder, and there
 and then decided to do some research in the construction and manufacturing
 of propellers.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What I didn't realize is that the information I was looking for only existed
 in a mathematicians nightmare of nomenclature with such terms as "Blade
 activity factor" and JN over V.
 There weren't any reference material available that actually tells you
 step by step how to install, maintain and care for a wooden prop.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this manual I have tried to bring all the experience I have learned through
 trial and error, comments and criticism, together so that you, as a pilot,
 may fly safely and securely, having knowledge based on fact and experience
 available at your finger tips.
 May I suggest that you keep this manual in the same location as your airframe
 logbook, pilot's license, maps etc.?.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Please study each section thoroughly and read it again and again as some
 very useful tips and hints are given throughout the book.
 There are as many stories concerning propellers as there are in The 1001
 Arabian Nights and should I choose to do so, I would be able to write a
 novel on the subject.
 Sadly some have resulted in serious injury and other in death.
 This is where I feel that this manual may be of some assistance to assist
 pilots whom are willing to open their eyes and ears to preventative maintenance.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Should there be any sections that are unclear or difficult to understand
 please contact me immediately before any installation is attempted.
 My current telephone number is (011) 793-5235.
 Should you choose to do so please write me at P.O.Box 446, Randburg, 2125.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Please do not regard any problem concerning your propeller as too trivial
 to answer.
 I have witnessed numerous installation attempts that were totally mind-boggling
 and having then confronted the guilty party as to the reason why his propeller
 and the resulting performance appeared worse than any imaginable miscarriage,
 I would receive the lame excuse of " I ONLY THOUGHT ..." or " I WASN'T SURE
 SO I ..." or " But so and So.'s prop was done like this and nothing has happened!"
 (as of yet!) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sometimes I received real nifty, snappy, macho, head held high, offensive-forwar
d-leaning-posture, hands-on-the-hips, eyes-bulging-out-of-their-sockets
 answers from the ever-clever HE-MAN type of pilot.

WHY WOOD? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a world abundant with countless combinations of plastics, fibers and
 composite materials, wood is the perfect, cheapest, most reliable complete
 composite material available in abundance, at a relatively cheap price.
 As a matter of interest all metals accumulate stress and fibers may crystallize
 and crack, or after being put under stress for a period of time retain
 the shape that it was forced to comply with.
 None of these affect wood! 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When wood bends it returns to its original shape again and again without
 sustaining fatigue, cracks, stress or hardening of materials.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It has either 100% memory or is broken! Consider the fact that there is
 a certain amount of resonance frequency between metal propellers and the
 engine but none at all in wood.
 Wooden props are approx.
 one third the weight of metal propellers and with care in choosing particular
 laminates for a particular propeller, the manufacturer will beat the weight
 of various composites hands down.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
WOOD 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Built into every propeller is 30 years of theoretical research and practical
 experience linked to S.A.'s harsh and varying climatic conditions.
 Before a prop has QA passed manufacturer identification and serial numbers,
 stringent manufacturing procedures and process plans are adhered to.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
P.PROPS are constructed from Eucalyptus Saligna/Grandis grown in the Tzaneen
 district.
 The timber is hand selected for quality and must pass a triple A Grade
 inspection i.e.: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A = nil knots, cracks, or physical deformities.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
AA = nil twisting, curving or cross grain.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
AAA = nil grain slope and 12% or less moisture content.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each laminate is split and planed to suit measurements and requirements
 for a particular design.
 A secondary inspection follows by which each laminate is closely scrutinized
 and weighed to ensure even distribution of weight in the final product.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
ADHESIVE.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The best quality Phenol-Formaldehyd adhesive is used in the laminating process
 where each blank is left under pressure for the full curing-period as specified
 by the manufacturer.
 This ensures the highest standard of glueline penetration.
 The adhesive is SABS approved, waterproof, UV protected and is chemical
 resistant.
 Once a blank is released from the press it is left for a "idling period"

\begin_layout Section
A BIT OF PROPELLER THEORY 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
CONSTRUCTION AND SHAPE
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Basically, a propeller consists of two or more blades attached to a central
 hub, which in low power engines is simply an extension of the engine crankshaft.
 Each blade is a rotating airfoil, which produces forces similar to those
 of an aircraft wing, but in doing so, transforms rotary power into axial
 (straight-line) thrust.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each blade has an airfoil section.
 The prop has differing sections starting off with a fairly large airfoil
 close to the hub and tapering evenly to a thin section at the tip.
 The result is that the propeller looks as if it has a twist in the blade
 (which it actually has).
 The reason behind the shape is that every section, when in motion, has
 to "screw" through the air exactly the same distance as its partner along
 the whole length of the blade.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sections may be compared to a line of laser cannons aiming at a target
 at the top of a mountain with one exception i.e.
 cannon 1 is at the base of the mountain cannon 2 is 1 km away, cannon 3
 is 2km away etc.
 up to cannon number 10 which is 9 km away.
 If one should then compare the elevations of the barrels one would notice
 a significant difference in the elevations of the barrels.
 Should the order to "FIRE!" be given then all 10 laser beams will reach
 the target at the same apex.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Imagine what the results would be if all the barrels of the laser cannons
 were set at the same elevation! Should the order to "FIRE!" be given the
 result would be that only one beam would hit the target while all the others
 would either overshoot or undershoot! That is the main reason why a propeller
 without twist which looks like a ruler will not work as well as one that
 has a twist developed into it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It stands to reason that there are thousands of combinations of elevations,
 better known as PITCH, available to service the various aircraft with their
 numerous applications in the industry.
 The amount of the elevation or Pitch is stamped into your propeller in
 the hub area.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another reason for the twist in the blades with the various sections set
 at various angles is that the speed of each section along the blade increases
 towards the tip and so ensures an even distribution of lift production
 along the blade.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When in motion a propeller is subject to similar forces as your aircraft
 wing.
 As the propeller turns it advances through the air in a helical or spiral
 path.
 This movement enables the airfoil sections to generate lift and produce
 thrust at the same time.
 It is this thrust that pulls or pushes the aircraft along to maintain a
 calculated airspeed at a calculated rotation speed.

FIGURE 2
\end_layout

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A tractor propeller is one that is mounted on the front of the engine drive
 shaft in the nose of the aircraft, and produces a thrust that pulls the
 aircraft along its intended flight path.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A pusher propeller is one that is mounted on an engine drive shaft where
 the engine is mounted in the rear of the aircraft and produces thrust that
 pushes the aircraft along it's intended flight path.
 Unfortunately taking the prop from the front of the aircraft and putting
 it in the rear means that the engine is now in front of the prop and facing
 to the rear.
 This means that the prop will now rotate in the opposite direction to the
 way it did with the same engine in tractor configuration.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Pusher propellers in the wake of wings are particularly bedeviled; the inflow
 angle changes with the angle of attack of the wing, and the propeller blade
 experience wildly varying flow conditions as they travel around the propeller
 disc.
 It was largely this effect that accounted for the early failure of the
 Beechcraft Starship to attain it's projected cruise performance.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
TYPES OF PROPELLERS.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are a variety of types of propellers ranging from a fixed pitch prop
 with no adjustment, to blades that may be adjusted from a feathering position
 to full negative pitch.
 This type of blade has a reversing mechanism that changes the rearward
 thrust to forward thrust to assist an aircraft in reducing speed after
 it has landed, thus shortening the landing run.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
FIXED PITCH PROPELLER 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A fixed pitch prop is of one-piece construction and made of wood, composites
 or a metal alloy.
 The blade angle or pitch is built into he prop when being manufactured.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
VARIABLE PITCH ( V.P.) PROPELLER.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This type of propeller usually has two possible pitch positions, one set
 for take-off conditions and one for cruising.
 It can be used in either position by a lever operating the propeller by
 means of oil pressure from the engine.
 There are also mechanically operated V.P.
 propellers, which give a range of possible positions b y means of a handle
 rotated in the cockpit.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
CONSTANT SPEED PROPELLER.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This type is usually only found on medium and large aircraft because its
 expense and greater complications outweigh the advantages on small aircraft.
 The constant speed propeller is controlled by a governor who controls the
 flow of oil in such a manner as to keep the R.P.M.
 at a steady value despite changes of speed and power.
 A lever in the cockpit can set the R.P.M required.
 In appearance this propeller is very similar to a VP, the addition of a
 governor unit usually being the only difference.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
HYDROMATIC PROPELLER.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This type of propeller is only found on large and powerful aircraft: it
 gives a very large range of pitch-change and is necessary on aircraft with
 a large range of operating speeds.
 This type of propeller is also capable of "feathering", a process that
 is desirable in the event of engine failure on a multi-engine aircraft.
 Feathering consists of turning the blades until they are in a fully coarse
 position, which is with the edge of the blade facing forward into the airflow.
 On multi-engine aircraft this reduces drag considerably on an engine that
 has failed.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The hydromatic propeller is, like the constant speed, operated by engine
 oil, boosted to a higher pressure by a special pump.
 Certain types are, however, electrically operated.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
CONTRA-ROTATING PROPELLERS.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On large engines, especially those fitted in single engine aircraft, it
 was found that TORQUE could obtain such large proportions that it had a
 very serious effect on the aircraft's flying characteristics.
 To annul the effect of torque for any given power output, two propellers
 one mounted behind the other and rotating in opposite directions were found
 very satisfactory, beside of being capable of absorbing more power without
 being of larger diameter.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
SCIMITAR PROPELLERS.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some slight advantages may be claimed from semi-scimitar props.
 The slight sweep-back on the blades and the tips may delay the onset of
 compressibility at high r.p.m thus reducing prop noise, and there is an element
 of automatic variable pitch effect due to the blade loading along the curved
 datum.
 This is however very small on most semi scimitar propellers.

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
PITCHING 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
WARNING: Props should not be pitched for extreme conditions.
 If the pitch is fine for quick initial acceleration (take off), the cruise
 mode will be very poor and the engine may over-speed as the aircraft speed
 builds up and the initial load on the engine is reduced.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
Too much pitch (coarse) will result in poor acceleration and considerable
 variation in R.P.M.
 in turbulent conditions as the prop "unloads".
 The power of the engine must be absorbed by the propeller to prevent over-speed
ing of the engine.

\begin_layout Section
EFFICIENCY AND THRUST 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
See figure 8 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To achieve the most efficiency out of your prop, you must utilize the most
 power from your engine and turn it into thrust.
 A prop is a device for converting the B.H.P.
 of the engine into usable thrust.
 Some effort is lost in the translation, and most props are from 60% to
 85% efficient.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Take a helicopter versus a Cessna 172, for instance.
 A four seater C-172 uses about the same hp as a two-seater helicopter.
 We all know that the helicopter will go up vertically.
 That is because it is turning a 8m-diameter blade at 300 rpm.
 If you were to pull a C-172 up vertical, that 75-inch prop turning at 2700
 rpm won't pull you up vertically.
 You could theoretically fly a C-172 on half the hp if you could swing a
 6m prop at 500 rpm.
 We all know that is impractical.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However the lesson to be learned is to swing the largest diameter prop at
 the slowest rpm possible thus the reason for the gearbox reduction units
 available to the microlight industry.
 We may safely conclude that a large diameter prop turning at 1800 rpm is
 more efficient at converting the hp available to thrust than a small diameter
 prop turning at 3600 rpm will.
 As a general rule, you don't want to turn your prop tips over 270m per
 second; 180m to 220m per second is more desirable.
 Your prop noise will also decrease with lower tip speeds.
 The efficiency of a direct drive is about 65 percent and is brought up
 to about 80 percent with a 2:1 reduction.
 A helicopter is about 90 percent efficient

 the installation procedures a couple of times so that you are quite sure
 of what has to be done where, when and how!

Should you be doubtful of or misunderstand any of the following procedures,
 please contact the manufacturer before attempting the installation of your

\begin_layout Enumerate
Prop Handedness
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Stand behind your aircraft facing in the direction of flight and make a
 note of the direction of rotation of the propeller.
 I suggest that you have a note-pad and pencil handy to jot down which direction
 your prop is turning and, if your prop is in the pusher (prop behind engine)
 or tractor (prop in front of engine) configuration.
 Don't laugh, I personally know of a couple of pilots that had to have the
 difference between a pusher propeller and a tractor propeller pointed out
 to them.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Imagine your propeller in a vertical position.
 If your prop turns anti-clockwise (towards the left) from the vertical
 position it is known as a "LEFT HANDED" prop.
 If it turns in a clockwise (towards the right) direction from the vertical,
 it is known as a "RIGHT HANDED" prop.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
You will now be able to identify your propeller as being one of four types:-

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
A very important point not to be missed is the fact that many aircraft have
 gearboxes fitted whilst others have belt drives and yet others are directly
 driven by the engine.
 A directly driven prop turns in the same direction as a belt driven prop,
 but a gearbox driven prop turns in the opposite direction to the engine.
 This fact is of particular importance when you order or buy a new prop.
 It has happened more times than I care to remember that a pilot on receiving
 his propeller discovers to his utter amazement that his aircraft has the
 full capability of trying to take off in the opposite direction of the
 intended flight! 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Prop Specifications
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Check if the length of the prop is recommended by the manufacturer of your
 aircraft (if the prop wasn't manufactured specifically for your aircraft
 in the first place).
 You may have a variation of one or two inches in length, but any longer
 or shorter than the length recommended by the aircraft manual may be detrimenta
l to the engine life and, may not have adequate ground clearance or adequate
 blade area to convert the power available into usable thrust.
 This may lead to a series of events which gives one goose pimples just
 thinking about it! 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Check if the manufacturer of your aircraft recommends the PITCH of the prop
 (if the prop wasn't manufactured for your aircraft in the first place.).
 There are several alternative pitches for your aircraft, all depending
 on what you are planning to do.
 For instance, most aircraft manufacturers specify an average pilot weight
 of 80kg and an average passenger weight of 80kg.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Should you weigh 100kg and your passenger the same, then the average pitch
 prop may not be able to get you out of your favorite strip.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The same rules apply to lightweight pilots, but in the reverse where a pilot
 weighing 70kg, plus passenger weighing the same, may have a phenomenal
 climb rate but will be penalized by higher engine RPM 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

One could use the above-mentioned example, juggle around the weight figures
 with full, half-full, or partially empty tanks, throw in some spares in
 a bag, carry a passenger etc., etc..
 and at the end of the day have a large choice of pitches for every possible
 situation!

\begin_layout Standard
We are establishing the fact that the drilling procedure should be done
 from one side of the hub i.e.
 the side that has to mate with the engine drive flange.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The reason a prop should be drilled starting at the engine flange side is
 as follows: Should your drill-press be out of alignment, the hole that
 is being drilled will start of correctly, but will deviate from its path
 the further it moves through the hub, eventually exiting on the other side
 at a slight offset.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Should this be true then the bolts inserted at the exit point will converge
 on the same measurement/size as the engine drive flange.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By this method we counter inaccurate drilling to a certain extent.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of course the idea is to drill the prop accurately in the first instance
 ...
 but I have yet to see a drill-press that doesn't deviate by 0.5mm over a
 distance of 100mm, especially so if the drill press is worn! 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If your prop is located up front, it is of the tractor type and the airfoil
 of the blades will be in front of the engine facing in the direction of
 flight.
 The opposite side of the hub will therefore be the one that has to mate
 with the engine drive flange and therefore will be facing upwards on the
 drill-press table and will be the side that the drill bit penetrates first,
 exiting on the even side where the airfoils are located.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If your prop is located behind the engine then it is a pusher type with
 the airfoils of the blades facing the engine and into the direction of
 flight.
 The area on the hub on the airfoil side will then be the one to mate with
 the engine drive flange, and therefore should be facing upwards on the
 drill table, and will therefore be the side that the drill bit penetrates
 first, exiting on the opposite side where there are no airfoils.
 (If you can understand this lot you must be nuts!) Unfortunately it is
 necessary to drill the propeller from the correct side to lessen the chances
 of the bolts converging everywhere else but in the correct pattern.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Step 5 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since we have established which side must be facing the drillbit, you may
 mark it with a pencil or marking pen lest you forget what goes where!

a) Lay the prop on the drill press table with the hub (which must mate with
 the engine flange) facing upwards, towards the drill bit.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
b) Insert the 25,4mm by 75mm shaft into the hub center hole.
 Push it down until the end of the shaft is flush with the bottom of the
 hub.
 Should you experience difficulty in inserting the shaft scrape it with
 some sandpaper and a bar of dry soap.
 If the fit is still tight then measure the shaft to see if it matches the
 center hole of the prop.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Use the 25,4 flat IRWIN drill bit and rotate it inside the center hole of
 the hub (by hand only) to get rid of any paint residue or wood fibers that
 may have expanded after the initial center hole drilling procedure.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
c) Place your engine back/front plate over the shaft so it fits snugly.
 If there is slight play between the plate and the shaft it may be taken
 up by wrapping a thin layer of masking tape around the shaft.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
d) Get a marking pen and number the holes on the plate in the sequence shown
 in figure 4.
 After having marked the holes rotate the plate to the position shown in
 figure 4.
 14 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The reason behind this thinking is that no two holes should be aligned in
 the direction of the centrifugal forces ( which are trying to pull the
 blades apart ).
 Each bolt should therefore carry its own load, and not share it between
 two others whilst the rest carry a dual amount of centrifugal weight and
 torsion forces.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
e) Keep your prop retaining bolts close at hand.
 Hold the back/front plate firmly in the down position.
 Drill all the boltholes to a depth of 30mm taking care to insert a bolt
 after each hole has been drilled.

 Be careful of drilling to fast or bearing down on the drill-press because
 as soon as the bit exits on the other side it may rip out a chunk of wood
 leaving an unsightly hole.
 Should it happen don't despair, there's a remedy for unsightly holes in
 here somewhere later.
 
\end_layout

So far so good ...
 At this stage you should have drilled all the holes in the sequence marked
 on the front/backplate and should all the bolts be standing up straight

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Remove the bolts, but keep them handy.
 Flip the prop so that the opposite hub-side is facing upwards.
 You should see only one hole on this side.
 Push the locating shaft through so the end of the shaft is flush with the
 bottom of the hub.
 Replace the front/backplate.
 Locate the hole by rotating the backplate and put a bolt through the backplate
 into the bolt hole, thus stopping movement of the plate.

\begin_layout Quote
NOTE: You may experience difficulty in inserting the bolts into your newly
 drilled prop.
 The reason being that the drill bit does not cut a perfect accurate hole
 through the wood fibers as is the case when drilling metal.
 The wood fibers are combed in the direction that the drill bit is turning.
 As soon as the drill bit has vacated the hole, the fibers relax and return
 to their original position causing the hole to shrink in size up to 0.5mm
 smaller than the bit size used.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
WARNING: At no stage should you attempt to force the bolts through the holes.
 They will become stuck, necessitating removal by force which may result
 in the propeller being rendered useless.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
Even if you should succeed in pushing the bolts through the holes and manage
 to fit the prop to the aircraft you may be certain that the wood fibers
 will expand even more.
 Should you then wish to remove the prop at a later stage, you may find
 that the prop won't budge at all, necessitating removal of the prop by
 force, which will, at this stage, definitely damage the propeller beyond
 repair.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
A secondary result of too tight a fit results in the bolts generating enough
 heat through friction to break, or to burn the hub beyond recognition.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Step 9 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Remove the drillbit from the drillpress and replace it with a bit that is
 0.5mm larger in diameter than the bolts you are using.
 Don't forget to tighten the chuck with the key and to remove the key afterwards.
 If left in position the key wi ll fly out in any direction and may cause
 serious injury to yourself or the person helping you! 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Step 10 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Clear all wood debris from the prop, holes and drillpress table.
 Remove the shaft and back/front plate.
 Align the holes with the drill bit.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Grasp the propeller firmly so that the drillbit does not snatch at the holes
 when you begin the next procedure.
 Switch the drill on and carefully run the oversize drill through the holes.
 Be sure to run it through from both sides of the hub to ensure the maximum
 removal of wood fiber along the walls of the bolt holes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
NOTE: You're bolts should be able to slide in and out of the holes very
 easily at this stage without undue play or stiffness.
 Do not be anxious if there is a small amount of play as the fibers will
 shrink the hole down from 8,5mm to approx.
 8,3mm or even 8,2mm.
 This is the ideal size we are aiming for in the first place.
 In any case the prop isn't driven by the bolts, but by the friction caused
 between the engine flange and the back/front plate due to the pressure
 effect between the bolts and nuts.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Step 11 Remedy for unsightly holes!

SETTING THE TRACKING

\begin_layout Subsection*
WHY SET THE TRACKING? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even though your propeller is balanced it may still create tremendous vibration
 in flight due to the fact that few people understand, or even have any
 idea of what the track of a propeller is.
 Many pilots don't know what it feels like to fly with a perfectly tracked
 propeller! From experience I can tell you it's a marvelous smooth ride.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you take your car to the tyre company for a wheel change and balance
 or to have new tyres fitted you may have noticed that each tyre is in turn
 put on a balancing machine, spun and then balanced by lead weights clamped
 onto the rim of the tyre.
 It isn't necessary to balance a propeller in the same way since we don't
 have a solid circle of rubber weighing in excess of 10kg turning on the
 engine flange ...
 
\emph on
But, should the axle of your car be bent out of alignment the wheel will
 be wobbling and running all over the show wearing out your transmission,
 shock-absorbers and rattling your teeth due to the vibration caused by
 an out-of-track tyre! 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The same applies to propellers.
 Your propeller may have been made by experts at NASA, and may have been
 balanced by a machine accurate to a billionth of a mm and costing gazillions
 of Rands....
 it will all be a total waste of energy and a useless exercise if the tracking
 of your propeller isn't set accurately! 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even the best made metal propellers have their tracking set even more so
 in the case of wooden props seeing that the wood itself is susceptible
 to imbedding and indenting by the hub.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You will need the following tools to ensure an accurate track setting:-
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
A solid stiff steel ruler (or similar) with a minimum length of 500mm.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
A roll-up type tape measure, marking pen and torque wrench calibrated in
 N/M.
 16 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
WARNING: Please familiarize yourself with the settings of your torque wrench
 before attempting to use it on the propeller.
 Failure to do so may result in over-torqueing the prop with the result
 that your flange will become embedded in the hub causing early failure
 of the wood fibers or else imprinting such a deep pattern that it will
 become utterly impossible to correct the tracking afterwards.
 It may also lead to having the prop returned to the manufacturer for a
 refacing job ...
 if possible! 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Make sure you know the torque on the bolts.
 Carelessness here may lead to a nasty Judgment Day: Namely, the prop might
 fly right off the engine.
 It's been known to happen and over-tightening is the culprit.
 That's because today's improved wood technology means that new props can
 withstand many more pounds torque than they used to.
 That may mean more pounds of torque than the bolts can handle.
 Many people don't realize that you can easily overtighten your bolts and
 seriously decrease their effective strength.
 If you us off-brand bolts, you can't depend on those torquing values because
 they are made in an uncontrolled environment.
 Always use AN hardware.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Don't attempt to tighten the bolts without a torque wrench.
 Guessing at values with a regular ratchet or monkey wrench is just another
 form of Russian roulette ...
 and you are guaranteed to lose.
 Torquing properly includes cross tightening.
 This refers to the sequence of tightening down the bolts.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Step 1 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Remove the engine spark-plugs and leads.
 Many a pilot I personally know is walking around with a view teeth missing
 and a huge scar on their face due to the prop rotating from engine pressure
 and whipping to a certain position only to be stopped by some ugly mug
 who forgot to remove the spark-plugs.....Not to mention the fact that some guy
 is walking around with half a brain after he forgot to check if the ignition
 switch was in the "off" position! 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Step 2 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using the steel ruler, place the end up against the lip of the center hole
 and measure in the direction of the leading edge of one of the blades for
 a distance of 75%.
 Make a 1mm dot on the curve of the leading edge with the marking pen.
 Where exactly on the curve is left to your judgment.
 Repeat the procedure on the opposite blade.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
NOTE! 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For ease of reference I shall name the one blade "A" and the other "B".
 It may be a good idea if you should mark your blades as well, seeing that
 one becomes easily disorientated whilst turning the blades from one position
 to the next.
 If you marked both blades correctly then both the dots on blade "A" and
 blade "B" should be in the same arc and the same distance from the sides
 of the center hole.
 Should the prop be spinning these dots would draw an imaginary circle 75%
 distant from the center hole.

 Measure the distance from dot "A" to a place on the airframe i.e.

\begin_layout Standard
This is the tricky part.
 The secret in achieving this lies in looking at the position of the shadow

 occupy the previous blades position 100% 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Measure the distance from the dot on blade B to the dot on the airframe.
 Make a note of the distance i.e.
 498mm.
 Subtract 498mm from 504mm and you get a difference in the tracking of the
 two blades of 6mm.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
NOTE!: This means that one of the blades is tracking 6mm ahead of the other.
 Should you fly with this setting you will experience a definite vibration
 throughout the aircraft.
 It is quite normal as the tracking has yet to be set.

\begin_layout Standard
Step 7 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
NOTE! 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following steps is of utter importance and should be done taking time

 On average it takes me about 30 minutes to accurately track a propeller,
 so you should spend about 40 min.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Rotate the prop so that blade "A" occupies the original position.
 Tighten the bolts closest to blade "A" by turning them not more than a
 quarter of a turn at any one time.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
NOTE! 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What you are actually doing is pulling blade "A" closer to the airframe,
 and seeing that the propeller is a unit, blade "B" shall move away from
 the airframe the same distance that "A" is moving towards the airframe.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Repeat steps 4, 5, and 6 until the difference in the tracking of the dots
 bottom out at 3mm or less i.e.:- 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A = 501; B = 501; difference in track = 0mm EXCELLENT!

I would like to bring the fact that I feel very neglected, to your attention.
 Okay, I know that you are a very careful pilot while inspecting your aircraft,

STORAGE CARE 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the event of your aircraft not being flown for a period of time it is
 advisable that your prop should be turned towards a horizontal position.
 Why don't you make a habit of doing so after each flight? Should you not
 fly for an extended period, (2 or more months) then remove the prop from
 the aircraft for storage.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Presumably the prop has been removed from the aircraft.
 What shall you do next?.
 Well, a thorough inspection is in order.
 The time may be ripe to send the prop in for renovation, as you wouldn't
 like to do so a couple of days before the flying season is upon you! 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Should the prop be in a good condition, as judged according to the 4 stages
 in the previous section, its a good idea to start with a thorough cleaning
 and waxing before long term storage and will doubly serve to retain the
 luster.
 Here is a list of handy items and procedures to follow:- 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
a) Have a soft cloth or a roll of paper towel handy.
 Keep a small bottle of methylated spirits and a tin of 
\shape smallcaps
Rally Car Wax
\shape default
 in the near vicinity.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
NOTE! 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
Don't use an oil based wax as the final finish on most wooden props is a
 lacquer based paint, the same as the motor-car manufacturers use on their
 vehicles.
 oil or bee's wax based polish will build up a layer of dust an may impair
 the balance of the propeller.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
b) Soak the cloth in meths and wipe the prop to remove oil and insect residue.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
NOTE! 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
Please! no thinners, petrol or similar products should be applied as they
 will damage the exterior paintwork with the result that your prop will
 need a costly refurbishing and balancing job.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
c) After having removed all traces of dirt, apply the polish as per instructions
 on the tin.
 After having polished the prop it should have a beautiful shiny smooth
 finish, ready to be wrapped in your wife's favorite winter blanket.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
d) Lay the prop on a blanket and roll it over and over so that none of its
 exterior surfaces protrude.
 If you really feel like it,  ...
 Use two blankets! Throw in a couple of mothballs for good measure, but
 don't let them touch the prop surface.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
e) Get a roll of masking tape (or similar) and tape the wrapped prop thus
 keeping it away from busy little hands that want to show daddy's propeller
 to the neighborhood kids.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
f) Find a cool, moisture free place where no-one can stumble over your prop
 and lay it down carefully in a HORIZONTAL position.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
WARNING: All wood contains moisture, it's the nature of the beast.
 the average wood prop has 12% or less moisture content.
 should the prop weigh in the region of 5kg's then a simple mathematical
 equation will show you that there is more than half a kg worth of moisture
 in the wood.
 from the above argument we can conclude that standing the prop in a vertical
 position will cause the moisture to migrate towards earth as gravity plays
 a constant roll in this case.
 (I should be called a dolt for writing this, ...
 .but one never knows.
 ...
 ?)

The obvious result would be that the prop becomes unbalanced and more so

All manufacturers of propellers know of and acknowledge the effects of an
 unbalanced prop so they go to extraordinary lengths to balance the prop.
 A propeller's performance is the direct result of the forces applied to
 it (the last link in the chain of vibration events).
 If you experience mild to severe vibration and the propeller has no obvious
 defects or pieces are missing, then you should take a serious look at the
 following: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Especially so if you have had a prop strike and the prop had to be replaced!
 In case of gearbox driven props your gearbox final drive should be checked

\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
Remember a runout of more than .005mm on the gearbox is of great concern.
 I personally know someone that caused two prop manufacturers a lot of money
 and wasted time/energy in trying to discover why his prop was vibrating
 wildly.
 It turned out in the end that his gearbox was subject to a heavy prop strike
 but the pilot refrained to mention this fact to the prop manufacturers.
 When the gearbox final drive-shaft was checked it was found to be out of
 alignment.

Only after monumental search all over S.A.
 could I establish that not one of the ten backplates were drilled precisely

\end_layout

This happens when the engine does two revolutions and the prop does one
 revolution, as is the case in a 2 to 1 reduction drive.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Should the engine then turn at 6000 RPM the prop would be turning at 3000
 RPM.
 The resulting " tune " is double pulse vibration that sounds like a " WHA-WHA-W

These types of reduction drives create a harmonic vibration wave which one
 of the most destructive type of vibration found, since it promotes metal
 fatigue at a tremendous rate due to the neat harmonic wave passing through
 the airframe.

The problem that presents itself in these cases can only be solved by fitting
 an unequal numbered ratio drive, hence the 2.24/2.58/3.47 gearbox drives on

PULSE-TYPE VIBRATION DUE TO AIRFRAME DESIGN IN PUSHER AIRCRAFT.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Do you have a odd shaped fuselage or object within 600mm of the prop arc?
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What you should be looking for is something like a new fuel tank fitted
 at the bottom of a seat or similar appendage in pusher type aircraft.
 What happens is that the propeller blades pass through a relatively clean
 incoming airflow 70% of the arc and then suddenly has to pass a 30% area
 where there is minimal airflow ( as in the case of a large object deflecting
 the airflow away from the prop or one that is not designed to have streamlined
 shapes ).
 The result will be a " PULSE-TYPE " vibration which sounds like a " WHUP-WHUP-W
HUP " type noise.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At low rpm it may be more pronounced with a definite wave passing through
 the airframe, and will increase to a whining like sound throughout the
 engine RPM range.
 The solution to this type of pulse vibration is rather obvious! Streamline
 the airflow around the several objects in front of your prop so that an
 equal amount of air reaches the blades.
 This type of vibration is rare in tractor type aircraft as the air being
 drawn into and accelerated by the prop is relatively clean.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Is the exhaust tailpiece close to the propeller? (don't laugh! The pulses
 exploding from the tailpiece synchronize with the prop and beats up on
 the prop).
 I have a recorded case where such a problem existed in a Vari-Eze where
 the prop and the exhaust gasses met at synchronized intervals setting up
 a severe harmonic vibration.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
OUT-OF-TRACK VIBRATION 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This type of vibration may be difficult to hear or check since it is a closely
 related to the above-mentioned groups of vibration.
 If a propeller is out of track it has two effects on the aircraft.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first is a wobbling effect which ruins bearings and eats casings and
 engine mountings for breakfast.
 The second effect is that the blades are pitched at different angles towards
 the incoming airflow.
 This is particularly true if you have a ground adjustable prop.
 The idea of a ground adjustable prop is excellent, but in the fact that
 one is able to adjust the pitch lies this type of propeller's Achilles
 heel.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the case of a fixed pitch prop the theoretical pitch is pressed into
 the hub, for instance "34P" which stands for 34 inches advancement in one
 revolution.
 If the prop is installed incorrectly then it is possible that one of the
 blades will have a 32P and the other will have a 36P.
 The result is that as the blades turn through the propeller arc the 32P
 blade will scoop a shallower amount of air than it's counterpart.
 We all know what that means!--VIBRATION! 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the case of a ground adjustable propeller the idea is to be able to adjust
 the pitch to suite the requirements of the client.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A good example is one where a pilot took various friends and family members
 to the local airfield to demonstrate his machines ability to fly, and also
 to take the braver customers for a flip.
 So far so good! The pilot installed a ground adjustable prop bearing in
 mind that aunt Gerty weighs 120kgs but cousin Jack weighs 40kgs.
 He then proceeded to demonstrate his abilities at handling aircraft, leading
 some members of the family into various levels of ecstasy whilst others
 started drooling on the tarmac, in this case aunt Gerty and cousin Jack.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Having had his propeller set by the experts who installed it and hopefully
 used accurate measuring instruments to set the required pitch, our friend
 whips out a couple of shifting spanners and proceeds deftly to loosen the
 retaining bolts and nuts of the prop.
 He then adjusted the blades according to the manual and equipment supplied
 with the propeller and started the engine." OOPS!",...the rpm seems a little
 high! He grabs the spanners and goes through the whole procedure again.
 AAAAH!,...the rpm is just right to lift aunt Gerty (Whom at this stage is
 doing a little impatient tap dancing),...
 but, oh-no, ...
 where did this vibration come from? HMMMM...
 must be that one of the blades are slightly out of track, our friend concludes.
 He calls for the spanners and adjusts the blades once more.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Start-up commences flawlessly and the prop is running true, smooth and aunt
 Gerty is safely strapped in.
 A preliminary engine run is done at the holding point where our pilot friend
 finds that some vibration has crept in somewhere, but with aunt Gerty's
 knees massaging his ears in anticipation he commences to open the throttle
 wide and zooms of in a cloud of dust, the prop doing a magnificent job
 of lifting the whole boodle into the air.
 Unfortunately the vibration seems to be getting steadily worse and by the
 time they reach the downwind leg aunt Gerty has lost her hearing aid and
 is suffering from eyeball co-ordination loss.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our friend realizes that something has gone horribly wrong and cuts the
 throttle followed by a complete engine shut-down whilst trying to maintain
 a reasonable descending rate.
 He tries to reach for the volume control on the intercom as aunt Gerty
 has, at this stage, hit all panic station buttons simultaneously and has
 reached 140 decibels from a pair of healthy "boere" lungs.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We shall leave this couple suspended in the air for the moment to reflect
 on what train of events have left them in this precarious position.
 The adjustment was done correct according to the manual, but Piet the pilot
 forgot to torque the bolts as he thought that a torque wrench is something
 that gorillas in mechanic overalls use whilst working on monster Chevy
 V-8 supercharged engines.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Obviously the blades have started to turn in their housings and have decided
 to assume different pitch positions! (but let's not tally here and return
 to Piet and aunt Gerty suspended in time, halfway through the base leg
 turn).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Having shut down the engine and volume control Piet has managed to line
 up with the runway coming in at an awkward angle.
 Gasps of amusement rise out of the bystanders mouths as a clump of hair
 promptly departs from aunt Gerty's head as Piet does a fair imitation of
 a flying brick attempting to break the worlds shortest landing record.
 Suffice to say all went well and nobody was injured nor was the aircraft
 damaged, save for the loss of faith in Piet's ability to correctly set
 up his prop.
 By the way, Aunt Gerty has recently had a more permanent hairpiece implanted,
 since the original scalp was never found and is probably warming some gopher
 families living-room.

PROP STRIKE! 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A propeller strike is a very serious event which may have deadly consequences
 for all involved in or in the near vicinity of an aircraft that has had
 a prop strike, and I feel it should be discussed in detail.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Any aircraft ever built and flown or has had the engine started is an excellent
 candidate for a prop strike.
 Any stationary or moving object in the near vicinity of an aircraft that
 is stationary or taxiing or flying may be drawn into, fall into, drop into
 or be scooped up into the blades.
 I have had a personal experience where a hamburger exiting through my aircraft
 window damaged my propeller to such an

extent that a emergency landing was called for.
 Fortunately I did not experience enough vibration to warrant a complete
 engine shut-down.

\begin_layout Subsection*
CHANCES OF A PROP STRIKE IN TRACTOR VERSUS PUSHER TYPE AIRCRAFT.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The chances of having a prop strike in tractor versus pusher prop aircraft
 are similar in various aspects but I'm not going to embark in the theoretical
 or statistical analysis of the above.
 What I do hope to bring to your attention is what the pilot should be aware
 of while operating his aircraft in whatever circumstances he may find himself
 in.
 At the least a rotating propeller has an enormous mind boggling energy
 force that will destroy anything that comes into contact with it, not to
 mention the pieces of propeller splinters being scattered about at subsonic
 speeds.
 Should the pieces strike a person or animal serious injury or dismemberment
 may take place instantaneously (to say the least) or, in the case of a
 direct strike to a vital organ, may kill a human outright.
 The point I would like to make can't be stressed enough as I personally
 have witnessed what the results are after someone accidentally stepped
 into the arc or had a member come into contact with a rotating propeller.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
HOW MANY TIMES? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A question often put to me is: " How many times would a propeller strike
 an object falling into the arc? ".
 It all depends on what revolutions the prop is doing at the time of the
 impact.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Following is a case study that I have done of such an incident where a pilot
 had lost all the fingers of his right hand.
 To illustrate the point I would like to tell you a true story.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A friend of mine,(we shall name him Mike), is the production engineer of
 a certain project he was working on at a military development institute
 at the time.
 He was running some much needed tests on the aircraft which included tuning
 of the engine with the throttle set to maximum rpm.
 The engine type is a four cylinder two stroke 45 hp motor capable of turning
 a 78cm propeller at 8000 rpm in a pusher direct drive configuration.
 To say that there was hardly space between the engine cowl and prop is
 the understatement of the century and a person had to be fairly dexterous
 to be able to reach the carburetor with a screwdriver while leaning forward
 in a slightly sideways attitude.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This particular day the engine was giving everyone involved a hard time
 and patience was at an all time low while some tempers were running high,
 since a tight schedule had to be completed by a the end of the day.
 It was four o'clock in the afternoon and the stage was set for a disastrous
 event.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The engine was run up for the umpteenth time, instrument readings were noted,
 the engine stopped, tuned, started up again and the whole process gone
 through again.
 Close to 4.30pm the results of the tests being done proved that only a slight
 adjustment was necessary.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Contrary to verbal warnings Mike proceeded to carefully lean over towards
 the carburetor to do some fine tuning with a screwdriver.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As fate would have it Mike dropped the screwdriver.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before realizing what was happening he instinctively reached out and made
 a grab for the screwdriver which at this stage was curving towards the
 roaring propeller.
 Mike felt a bump and promptly withdrew his hand.
 As everything was still in running order he glanced at his hand and noticed
 a small amount of blood seeping out of what seemed to be a small scratch.
 He promptly whipped out his handkerchief, dabbed the blood away and proceeded
 to bend over to retrieve the screwdriver which lay close by.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At this stage one of the technicians walked over, hit the kill switch, and
 asked Mike to show him his hand.
 Mike withdrew the handkerchief and suddenly there was large amount of blood
 flowing from an area where some fingers had been a couple of minutes ago.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Needless to say Mike was rushed off to the nearest hospital while some of
 the technicians set out to look for the missing fingers with the idea that
 they may be reunited to Mike's hand.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
None were found.
 ...
 ! 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A week or two later I had a chat with Mike about the accident.
 His hand was still swathed in bandages and one noticed by the expression
 on his face that he was still suffering from traumatic amputating pain.
 In the discussion we had he pointed out to me that the wound was of a very
 clean cut, and that the area were his fingers had been appeared to have
 been removed by a surgeon's knife.
 The only visible damage to the propeller was some small dents in the leading
 edge.
 One question that arose out of our discussion was:- Just how many times
 did the propeller strike his hand? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We both agreed that the time he took to react to the bump on his hand never
 exceeded 0.5 seconds.
 Since the prop was turning at 8000 rpm at the time of the encounter and
 there are two blades to a prop the mathematical calculation was done as
 follows:- 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
8000 revolutions per minute = 133.33 revs per second.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since there are two blades it means that both blades would pass a stationary
 object 266.66 times a second.
 Assuming that his fingers were in contact with both blades for 0,5 seconds
 the answer was that his fingers were struck at least 133 times.
 Therefore the reason that no trace of his missing fingers could be found.
 They were transformed from solids to gases instantaneously! 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Not all of the aircraft engines in the industry is capable of turning a
 prop at such high rpm but consider that a prop turning at an idle speed
 of 825rpm will strike a stationary object 27.5 times in a second! 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
NEED I SAY MORE??? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
------- oOo ----- 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
HOW HARD? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Many times I have been questioned about the force it would take to stop
 a prop rotating at 2500rpm.
 I decided to do some mathematical guesstimating of what a typical prop
 would weigh at that speed.
 I took an average weight of 5kg as being a fair representative of your
 average off-the-wall wood propeller.
 Turning at 2500 rpm I arrived at an answer of anything between 3500kgs
 up to 5000kgs as being a reasonable figure representing the centrifugal
 weight in kilograms of both blades as they spin around the axis.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A typical 70 inch propeller turning at 2500 rpm has a tip speed of 837 kph.
 Should an object the size of a match box collide with the prop at this
 stage the object will be accelerated to the speed of the tips.
 Needless to say that the weight of any object falling into the propeller
 arc will hardly be felt by the forces driving the prop.
 It would probably have less effect on the rotation speed of the propeller
 than a gnat's eyelash would have on a motor-car windscreen.
 I wouldn't even like to speculate on what the results will be if a human
 should walk blindly into such a situation! 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Should the object be a smallish stone of 15mm in diameter it would resist
 the blow and be accelerated to the same speed as the propeller (in case
 of a direct strike).
 The stone itself turns into a missile roughly equaling the speed of the
 prop which could injure or kill a person for hundreds of meters around.
 Should the object be of such a size as to cause disintegration of the propeller
 the splinters become flying daggers able to penetrate a 20mm pine-board
 and covering a 120 degree area towards the front of the propeller for approxima
tely 100 meters! 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I have witnessed numerous scenes of the destructive force of a propeller
 in the process of disintegration.
 I am reminded of an incident were a pilot had parked his trike inside his
 garage to do some maintenance work on the engine.
 After having serviced and tuned the engine he proceeded to accelerate the
 running engine to maximum static revolutions in order to iron out any small
 tuning problems.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Against the back wall of the garage stood a metal cabinet similar to those
 found in most schools to store stationary and miscellaneous items.
 The floor of the garage was slightly uneven with the result that the cabinet
 had a natural rocking motion forwards and backwards.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
THE STAGE WAS SET, CURTAINS DRAWN FOR THE FINAL ACT.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the trike was put into the garage with the propeller facing the cabinet,
 the hurricane propwash was directed directly towards the cabinet which
 was about 1,5 meters distant.
 As he stood watching with utter fascination in a horrific sort of way,
 he saw the cabinet start rocking forwards and backwards in a macabre dancing
 jig.
 At this stage he recalls that he seemed to be dreaming and felt as if he
 was in a hypnotic trance-like state of mind as his eyeballs told his mind
 to wake up and cut the throttle.
 The cabinet was rocking to and fro at an accelerated rate while he moved
 forward to cut the throttle, but seeing that the cabinet had given in to
 gravitational forces he turned and started to run while his head was looking
 in the opposite direction.
 The cabinet arched forward picking up speed as gravity took its natural
 course and with a tremendous "RRRRRROOOOMMPPPHHH" fell into the arc of
 the prop.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At this stage his head had disappeared into his chest cavity doing a splendid
 imitation of a headless chicken escaping the scene of the crime.
 There was a seconds worth of whizzing sound as if a thousand bee-hives
 were upturned and then complete utter silence.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Daring to have a look and venturing forth he found utter devastation and
 chaos in the garage.
 Remnants of the propeller were strewn in and around the mangled remains
 of the cabinet door.
 Pieces of cement plaster were chipped from the wall.
 What really drew his attention was a hole the size of a grown mans fist
 in the asbestos ceiling were an obviously large chunk of wood had made
 a rapid exit.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Being curious to the extend of the damage caused by the disintegrating propeller
 he proceeded to inspect the hole in the ceiling.
 The first thing he noticed was daylight streaming in from above.
 He then fetched his ladder climbed up and looked through the hole to see
 were the daylight was coming from.
 To his utter amazement he found that two standard cement roof tiles had
 disappeared and had left a huge gap in the roof! One can only speculate
 on the power and force of the propeller splinter that had exited through
 the ceiling AND the cement roof tiles.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He never found the splinter but had ample evidence of its destructive force
 in the form of cement tile pieces laying about in his garden.

ACTIONS IN CASE OF A PROPELLER STRIKE 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
WHILST AIRCRAFT IS STATIONARY.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Switch the engine off as soon as possible as the resulting violent vibration
 may cause more objects to drop of the engine into the remnants of the damaged
 prop which may lead to multiple strikes and even more damage to the aircraft
 or objects in the near vicinity.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Pusher type of aircraft are more susceptible to multiple strikes after the
 initial impact.
 I am reminded of such a case where a microlite trike had a stationary strike
 after the pilot had left a spark-plug spanner on the engine head.
 The spanner fell into the arc whilst the pilot was doing a full power revolutio
n check.
 The propeller disintegrated instantaneously throwing spanner and pieces
 of wood through the trailing edge of the wing.
 Instead of hitting the kill switch immediately the pilot watched in shock
 and amazement as the remnant of the prop continued to turn at full power
 causing the aircraft to vibrate at a tremendous rate.
 The resulting vibration loosened the air-filters before one could swear
 and then one after the other fell into the arc and was catapulted away
 through the tattered dacron.
 After having overcome his initial shock the pilot hit the kill switch and
 the whole bouncing boodle came to a stop.
 A couple of days later the pilot found that the engine mountings and rubber
 couplings had started to shear as a result of the extreme unbalanced violent
 shaking and vibrating of the broken propeller.

\begin_layout Standard
A prop strike in mid-air is one of the most dangerous situations one can
 imagine to experience.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Experiencing a prop strike in flight may have disastrous consequences should
 the pilot hesitate before cutting the engine.
 However the chances are much less than being on the ground due to the fact
 that there are less objects floating around than standing around on the
 ground.
 Pusher type microlights are more susceptible to this type of propeller
 failure due to the fact that any object that exits from the aircraft will
 be drawn into the blades and catapulted into eternity.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the case of microlight aircraft most prop strikes in mid-air are the
 result of objects (tools) left on the engine which did not fall off on
 take off.
 In the ten years of experience I have had in the repair and servicing of
 propellers I have found the following objects to be the biggest cause of
 propeller strikes: Plug-spanners, screwdrivers, nuts, bolts, air-filters,
 various parts and pieces of the exhaust assembly, pieces and parts of the
 carburetors ( in one case a float bowl), and old plugs.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second culprit in line is the passenger.
 Following is a list of the various objects that have dropped out of pockets
 and from heads as well as departing from various areas around the pilot
 and passenger: Lighters, cigarettes, keys, spectacles (plenty!), maps,
 a radio, an intercom set, flying goggles (plenty!) a set of false teeth,
 pens, pencils, gloves, scarves (by the dozen), a wedding ring, a coke tin,
 a compass, a stop-watch, a tin opener, various types of food and refreshments,
 and objects departing from saddle bags.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dear reader, you will be amazed at the damage a hamburger in clingwrap can
 do (four inches lost from the tip of one blade).
 I can speak for myself as that is exactly what happened to me.
 The shock and vibration one experiences is frightening to say the least.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us assume that you have:- 1) heard a terrific bang and 2) the aircraft
 gave a sudden lurch and then 3) there is a sudden increase in vibration.
 At this stage you may safely conclude that something has gone through the
 prop.

If the vibration is so bad that your eyeballs are shuddering and your teeth
 are set a rattling in their cages then it is time to hit the kill switch
 no matter where you are! There isn't a terrain on earth that will give
 you worse results on landing than the results you will get should the engine
 decide to part company with your aircraft taking various bits and pieces
 of the fuselage along with it! I couldn't imagine a worse situation to
 be in than one where a driving force of 2000kgs suddenly becomes an unbalanced
 demon weighing 1000kgs or more turning at 2200rpm.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you find that the vibration is bad (after having throttled back completely)
 but not to such an extent that you cannot see, then you must look for a
 place to land immediately and do so sooner than later! 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you find that the vibration has diminished (after having throttled back
 completely) then you may assume that the propeller is damaged, but not
 to such an extent that it would disintegrate immediately you must still
 look for a place to land immediately and do so sooner than later! 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you find that there is hardly any vibration at all (after having throttled
 back) then you may assume that little or no damage was done to the propeller
 then you must still look for a place to land and do so sooner than later!

WHAT AREA? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another interesting fact that needs to be discussed is the often asked question:
- "What area does a typical propeller of, say, 66 inches cover in one revolution
?" Again the answer depends on the rpm the prop is doing at the time.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Take for example your average two bladed microlight propeller fitted to
 a 2.58/1 gear-driven reduction drive with a dual carburetor ROTAX 503 producing
 approx.
 52 hp at sea level being the driving force.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A simple calculation using 3.14 * radius to the power of two shows the area
 covered by one single blade in one single revolution.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus:- area covered, one rpm, one blade = 3.14*(33 inches * 33 Inches) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So:- 3.14*(83,82mm * 83,82mm) = 22060 sq.
 or 2,2 sq.
 meters covered by one blade in one revolution.
 We have to add 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
2,2meters to the answer to find the area covered by both blades.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So:-2,2 + 2,2 meters = 4,4 sq.
 meters covered by both blades in one revolution.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Should the engine be revving at 6600 rpm (typical of a ROTAX 503 30 meters
 after take-off) it means that the prop is turning at 6600 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
divided by 2.58 which = 2558 revolutions per minute.
 Remember there are two blades so we have to say that a blade will pass
 a stationary object 2558 * 2 which = 5116 TIMES PER MINUTE ! 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Divide 5116 by 60 seconds to obtain the count that both blades will pass
 a stationary object every second and we find that the answer = 5116
\backslash
60 = 85 times per second.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Multiply 85 * 4,4 sq.
 meters we find that both blades cover an area of 374 sq.
 meters per second! This is roughly equal to the area covered by two tennis
 courts! If we then multiply the area of 374 sq.
 meters by 60 ( to find the area covered by a two-bladed propeller in one
 minute) we find that it covers an area of 22440 sq.
 meters in one minute.
 Mind boggling if one compares it to a tarred runway with a length of 2244
 meters or two kilometer with a width of 10 meters! And all of this in one
 minute! One could land a BOEING 747 on such a long runway! 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
WHAT DISTANCE? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally the last of the most often asked questions concerning propellers
 in general is:- "What is the distance the tip of a propeller travels in
 1) a second 2) a minute 3) an hour".
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The question is answered by doing a simple mathematical calculation using
 the formula for calculating the circumference of a circle i.e.
 2 * 3.14 * radius.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's use the same propeller length of 66 inches with the same gear-drive
 and same engine as mentioned in the previous chapter.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then:- 2 * 3.14 * 33 inches = 207 inches or 5257mm.
 5275mm = 5.275meters in one revolution 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So:- 5.275 meters * 2558 rpm = 13493 meters distance traveled in one minute
 or 13 and a half kilometers! Multiply 13.5 by 60 to get to km per hour and
 we find a total distance of 780 km covered in one hour which roughly equals
 the distance from Jo'burg to Margate, Upington, or Graaf-Reinet in the
 Cape! It equals the speed of a cruising Boeing! 
\end_layout

TWO BLADES VERSUS MULTI-BLADES.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This topic is one which needs frank discussion to sort out the old wife's
 tales from the facts that really matter.
 Here are the facts, please read them carefully.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1) A single bladed propeller is the most efficient means of converting power
 to thrust.
 Yes, read it again and again, your eyes aren't deceiving you.
 I'll say it again a bit louder this time.
 A SINGLE BLADED PROPELLER IS THE MOST EFFICIENT TYPE OF PROPELLER AVAILABLE
 TO PILOTS.
 The next obvious question coming to mind varies from one of total disbelieve:
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

How can that be?" to a plain "Why?" to "Could it be possible?".
 The answer is YES! The less air is disturbed as it is being transferred
 from one position to another, the more efficient the process is.
 A single bladed propeller would scoop and sweep a huge chunk of air very
 efficiently with minimal disturbance and fuss.
 Alas, the practical problems encountered in strengthening the main bearing
 between the prop and engine to resist the continues thrust, shake and shudder
 of the engine transferring the power to the prop is huge ...
 to say the least! 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So....the next best thing that the first designers of propellers did was to
 distribute the load between two propellers and "Hey Presto!" all the problems
 with a single bladed prop disappeared out the window 
\emph on
although
\emph default
 there was a small fine to pay in the sense that they were less efficient
 in transferring the power to thrust.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Remember the Cessna versus Helicopter? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the flight speeds obtained in the first 10 years of aircraft development
 the two bladed propeller served the industry well.
 The average speed-range that the prop had to cover and serve ranged from
 20 to 120 mph.
 Exactly were 70% of modern light aircraft and microlight aircraft are cruising
 today! 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As engine power and aircraft design increased by leaps and bounds so did
 the design of propellers increase up to such a point that multi-bladed
 propellers made their appearance.
 At this stage the designers did not care about the loss of efficiency as
 the engines developed at the time put out enough power to overcome this
 problem.
 A typical example of the growth in engine power output and aircraft design
 can be seen in the various models of the spitfire produced in Britain in
 the second world war.
 The very first models came out with a two bladed propeller, then three,
 four, and then five blades with in-flight adjustable pitch control.
 Unfortunately a propeller's pitch can only be increased so much before
 it is turned directly into the direction of flight and becomes useless.
 As aircraft designs improved and higher speeds could be obtained it got
 to the stage were something better than engine and propeller combination
 was necessary, namely the turbine engine.
 This signaled the end of the propeller era in fighter aircraft but definitely
 not in the light aircraft industry.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The reasons being that: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
A two bladed propeller disturbs less air while rotating than a three blader
 does.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
A two blader converts the power of the engine to usable thrust more efficiently
 than a three blader.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
A two blader creates less noise.
 If a two blader creates "x" amount of noise a three blader will always
 create "x + 1".
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
A two blader weighs less than a three blader thus power output is better.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The only reason one should consider using a three bladed propeller is when
 one has structural limitations i.e.
 ground clearance (the clearance between the tip of the prop and the runway
 when the aircraft is in a level flight attitude).
 
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Should one look at the type of propellers the single engine light aircraft
 industry use we find that aircraft that have three blades also have in-flight
 adjustable pitch control AND cruise at speeds above 120 mph.
 These two facts are related directly in the sense that the range that the
 propeller has to work at has been extended dramatically.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider using three or more blades when:- 
\end_layout

Important but not critical.
 Obviously the more the better ...
 Up to a point! Building a concrete support one needs a certain amount of
 steel reinforcement.
 Too much steel and the beam will crack.
 Too much concrete and the beam will crack.
 Too much glue = NO,NO.
 Too much wood = NO,NO.
 Between 6 and 12 laminations is adequate for most wood propellers.

PROP NOISE.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you're looking for the legal aspect pertaining propeller noise you're
 definitely reading the wrong book.
 What needs to be discussed here is the noise generated by the propeller
 from a stationary position to taxiing to rotating speed to cruise speed
 to max.
 straight and level speed.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next time you're at the local airfield and you see a Cessna doing a run-up
 at the hangers and then taxiing to the holding point take a walk to the
 runway.
 Stand at a point about one third the length of the runway away from the
 holding point.
 Open your ears wide and just listen.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sound that you hear with the Cessna engine at idle is a definite rhythmic
 beat: "BORRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR.
 ...
 " 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the pilot goes through his check-list he will do an engine run-up which
 sounds hollow, like this: "wwwwwWWWWWHHHHHHHHOOOOOOOOOOORRRRRRRrrrrrrr.
 ...
 " 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While stationary the pitch on the prop is set at a high angle(relative to
 the inflow of the air) and is churning the air and doing ...Nothing! Except
 generating a miniature dust storm behind the craft.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next the pilot taxi's to the threshold and after having done all the necessary
 checks proceeds to open the throttle.
 Again the hollow sound is generated as the prop struggles to work.
 As the Cessna gathers speed the relative inflow angle of the air diminishes
 and the prop performance creeps up the efficiency scale.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
200m down the runway the CESSNA is approaching lift-off speed and the propeller
 has reached the inner curves of the efficiency scale.
 At this stage a wonderful change takes place as the "WWWWWWHHHHHHHHOOOOOOO"
 sound diminishes in decibels and becomes a smooth "wwwwwhhhhhhoooommmmmmmmmmmmm
mmmmmmmmmmmmmm...." sound.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The relative inflow angle of the air has rapidly diminished whereas the
 efficiency range of the propeller has been reached, thus causing the change
 in the sound emitting from the prop.
 Instead of thrashing about in the air, while stationary or at low speed,
 the prop is rapidly ascending the efficiency scale and producing usable
 thrust instead of noise.

 will appear out of the blue yonder and commence to amaze and thrill the
 crowds.
 However, what I would like you to do next time you see them flying about,
 is to pay attention to the way the smoke behind the PITTS behaves while
 executing maneuvers.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you look closely you will notice three distinct smoke patterns:- 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1) As the PITTS travels in a straight and level path, with smoke switched
 on, you will notice that the smoke-trail is left virtually stationary behind
 the aircraft.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
2) The smoke-trail is cut into fairly distinct segments.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
3) As the PITTS does a shoot-up and reaches the apex of it's climb, the
 aircraft ceases to fly and becomes a stationary object for a second or
 two, in an upright position.
 
\emph on
Watch the smoke!
\emph default
 You will notice that the smoke is being pumped out behind the aircraft
 at a tremendous speed, without any segments or pattern at all.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
EXPLANATION:- 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Pattern 1 shows us that the propeller is working at maximum efficiency.
 Hardly any air is being wasted as it is being transferred from one position
 to the next.
 The prop is "paddling" through the air, without disturbing it much.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Pattern 2 shows us the segments of air that the prop has cut, whilst rotating.
 Beautiful! 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Pattern 3 shows us how the prop is thrashing around whilst stationary producing
 absolutely nothing but mixed turbulent air.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we could have the same smoke machine fitted to a high drag aircraft,
 i.e.
 a MicroLite, and we could look at the smoke trail left behind the MicroLite
 all we will ever see is pattern number 3.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A prop on a MicroLite can be compared to a motor-car.
 The rear wheels are doing the pushing by means of traction, but the brakes
 on the front wheels of the motor-car are binding.
 The driver accelerates and the rear wheels start to spin, kicking out smoke
 as the tyres strive to get a hold on the tarmac.
 Even though the car moves forward the front wheels keep braking and the
 rear wheels keep spinning at low speed, high speed, or cruising speed.
 It does not matter at what speed a microlite travels, it will always have
 a noisier and less efficient propeller than aircraft which are streamlined.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amateur built aircraft fair a bit better than microlite aircraft in the
 sense that they are more streamlined, thus the prop has better traction.
 An Evans V.P.
 homebuilt has less traction than a KR2.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A KR2 has less traction than a PITTS etc.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
CONCLUSION: The smoother and streamlined the aircraft is, the better will
 the prop perform.
 The noise generated by the propeller of a stationary aircraft or a high
 drag aircraft is normally more than the noise generated by streamlined
 aircraft.

EFFECTIVE RANGE OF PROPELLERS 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What is the average effective range that a fixed pitch two bladed propeller
 covers may be asked? The answer is fairly simple and straight forward:-
 Approx.
 80 to 100 mph.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Any light aircraft ever built has the following characteristics put into
 the design:- 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Stall speed

Rotating speed.( The speed that the craft is doing when the wheels leave
 the runway) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\begin_layout Enumerate
Minimum cruise speed.( To maintain a straight and level flight path at a

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Medium cruise speed.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Maximum straight and level speed.
 (Without over speeding the engine) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's take an example of a light aircraft for instance a Cessna 150.
 The typical stall speed under normal workload is 55mph, economical cruise
 of 95mph and a maximum straight and level of 125mph.
 The propeller is of a fixed pitch type and must be able to cover the usable
 speed range of the Cessna i.e.
 start to become efficient at 40mph and start to diminish in efficiency
 at 140mph and be at its most efficient rating from 70 to 120 mph.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A fixed pitch two bladed propeller covers the requirements well in this
 case but not in the case of a Cessna 210! The Cessna 210 needs a propeller
 that will become efficient at 40mph be efficient from 90 to 160 mph and
 start to diminish in efficiency at 200mph.
 A startling range of 160mph needs to be covered! Unfortunately a fixed
 pitch prop will not cover this range so an in-flight adjustable pitch propeller
 is required to stretch the bottom end and top end of the propeller capabilities
 with various settings in between to compensate for workload, altitude and
 various other factors involved.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Judging from the above facts we can safely conclude that it is an absolute
 waste of money, time and energy to fit a similar propeller to a microlight
 as the performance of microlights in general do not even come close to
 the range of speeds that a standard fixed pitch propeller can cover in
 normal circumstances! 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
27 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To illustrate the above statement we shall look at requirements of a typical
 trike configuration microlight were the stall speed is 30mph and the maximum
 straight and level speed is 85mph.
 This gives us a range of 55mph that needs to be covered by the propeller
 efficiently.
 As said before a fixed pitch propeller can cover 100mph max.
 and so will have no problem at all in servicing the complete spectrum of
 light homebuilt aircraft and microlight speeds available today!

The truth of the matter is that the measuring of static thrust must be held
 accountable against some sort of comparable device!

A certain prominent member in the microlight fraternity imported a microlight
 and set about developing and improving on the product.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Eventually things got to such a stage were two propeller manufacturers were
 asked to develop and manufacture a propeller to suite the characteristics
 of the particular model and to submit the propellers for further flight
 testing by the manufacturer.
 Hanging on the outcome of the results of the tests were a nice fat propeller
 contract so needless to say both manufacturers set out to stake a claim
 in a lucrative business.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Both busied themselves with their slide-rules and soon produced a model

\begin_layout Standard
The day of testing dawned and found everybody involved in the project eagerly
 rigging up a scale to the closest pine tree at hand.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the manufacturers of the propellers that were to be tested saw this
 and asked the head of the project what they were actually planning to do
 with the set-up under the tree.
 He was told that a "STATIC THRUST CHECK" was to be done to see which of
 the propellers would tie up the contract.
 The manufacturer immediately balked and told the head of the project in
 no uncertain terms that it was a totally waste of time and may in the end
 be outright dangerous to fly an aircraft with a propeller that produced
 maximum static thrust at "Zero" mph forward speed.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unfortunately his remarks were ignored as the first propeller was already
 fixed to the engine and was roaring lustily in the early morning air.
 A reading was taken at three various settings and noted on paper for further
 reference and comparison between the two propellers.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It turned out that the first propeller was producing at least 40kg worth
 of thrust more than the latter.
 With these figures dancing before the eyes of the owners of the aircraft
 the second propeller was removed and dropped on the spot, much to the displeasu
re of the manufacturer that had voted no confidence in this type of testing.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Deliriously happy, the head of the project (whom also doubled as the test
 pilot) promptly took possession of the aircraft controls and proceeded
 to taxi to the take-off point from were further in-flight tests on the
 suitability of the propeller would be checked out.
 Throwing the cautioning words of the prop manufacturer to the wind the
 test pilot commenced to open the throttle wide and let the brakes go.
 The aircraft leapt forward like a bat out of hell and proceeded to gather
 speed to set the new land speed record for microlight aircraft.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From the above facts we can deduct that this propeller has run out of pitch
 at a very critical stage of flight.
 The initial energy stored and released on the take off run has been expended
 and the thrust producing levels of the propeller has been diminished to
 a point where it could not satisfy or even maintain the load demands of
 the aircraft.

Fortunately the test pilot could land straight ahead and did not end up
 as a smashed heap of scrap Aluminium.
 A very shaken test pilot and crew held an emergency meeting on the spot
 to discuss the reluctance of the aircraft to gain height.
 It was at this stage that the manufacturer of the propeller that had produced
 100kg.
 of thrust stepped into the crowd and pointed out the fact that the propeller
 that they had been using was pitched to low and thus the static thrust
 had diminished rapidly as the airspeed of the aircraft increased.
 The only reason that the aircraft had lifted of was the fact that it had
 speed and inertia but the propeller could not maintain initial power output.
 As the aircraft gained speed the propeller was producing less and less
 thrust! 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second propeller was fitted to the aircraft and the results were remarkable.
 The initial run was slower than before but as the aircraft gathered speed
 the propeller produced more and more thrust as it moved closer and closer

 laser cannons so that each laser hits the beacon.

 we will find that the barrel of the cannon closest to the tower is elevated

 The second cannon will have less elevation than the third or the fourth
 and so on up until the tenth cannon who will have the least elevation of
 all.

Should we measure a propeller of 63 inches long with a pitch of 34 inches
 we find that each station or section has a certain amount of degrees built
 into it.
 The reason is that all the sections should work together in harmony and
 not fight each other which would subtract from the total effectiveness
 of the blade.
 Should we measure the degrees that the blade is set at station 75 then
 we see that it is less than the degrees at station 60, 50 or 40 and more
 than the degrees of station 80, 90 and 100.

Once again the example of laser cannons spaced equally away from a tower
 can be used.
 We discussed the different angles that the different stations are elevated
 at to be able to strike a single target at the top of the tower.
 Each time that the cannons are moved towards the tower or away from the
 tower each station or section will have to adjust their elevation angle
 of their barrels accordingly.
 Should the "General" in charge of the laser cannons order an increase in
 elevation of 3 degrees at station 70 then subsequently all the other station
 will add 3 degrees to their laser cannon barrels as is the case with ground
 adjustable propellers.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The result are that the cannons at stations 10, 9, and 8 will overshoot
 on the target at he top of the tower while station 70 will be spot-on target
 and stations 60, 50, 40, and 30 will be undershooting and hitting the base
 of the tower!

SPINNERS 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A spinner is that part of the aircraft that fits over the hub and around
 the blades of a propeller.
 It has a aerodynamic cone-type shape and is made of spun cast Aluminium
 or sometimes of a composite material.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most light aircraft have spinners fitted.
 The reasoning behind this piece of equipment is twofold.
 The first is that the inflow of air from the front of the aircraft, while
 flying, should be "cut" and be deflected outwards towards the working area
 of the prop.
 The second reason is that the incoming air should not strike a flat area
 head-on, as in the case where the hub of a prop is facing directly towards
 the front.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We all know what this means.....DRAG! Air strikes the center hole and frontal
 area of the hub, is forced in, must get out again, curls up on itself,
 gets forced out again against the incoming airflow, builds up a pressure
 layer, twists around the prophub, is accelerated by the rotating blades
 and ripped apart by the motion, hurled against the cowling, forced into
 the engine, and finally thrusts around the airframe.

\begin_layout Standard
INFLUENCES ON YOUR PROPELLERS PERFORMANCE 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let me state here and now that a propeller's performance is the direct result
 of the aircraft and engine specification.
 A specific propeller is designed for a specific aircraft and will vary
 in performance from one aircraft to the other and that is why there are
 hundreds of different length propellers with thousands of different pitches
 as well.
 The combinations that can be made is literally endless.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
AIRCRAFT SHAPE.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The obstacles in front of and behind a propeller has a great influence on
 the performance and power output of your propeller.
 Should you have a massive windscreen or cowling or a combination of both
 behind your prop the effect would be that the prop is actually trying it's
 best to blow the obstacles away, but can't do so because prop and engine
 are connected.
 A terrible state of affairs.
 Say, for argument's sake the propeller has a disc area of 5 sq.
 meters and say the windscreen and cowling has a flat-plate area of 3 sq.
 meters.
 Your propeller is 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
trying to blow the 3sq.meters away! What an absolutely useless waste of power
 and energy! 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Should you have a pusher type aircraft with obstacles like engine, fuel
 tank, or fuselage in front of the propeller the result is that the prop
 suffers from starvation of inflow of good solid clean air.
 This is amplified if one has a three-bladed propeller fitted, as in a pusher
 configuration.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
THE IDEA IS TO LET THE PROP WORK IN CLEAN INCOMING AIR, ACCELERATE IT AND
 MOVE IT IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION OF FLIGHT WITHOUT INTERFERENCE OF ANY
 KIND.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unfortunately one has to put the aircraft somewhere! 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
ENGINE POWER OUTPUT VERSUS PROPELLER OUTPUT.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Propellers never vary in their performance and power output.
 As a matter of fact there is no better means of measuring the performance
 of an engine short of removing the engine from the aircraft and having
 it diagnosed at the nearest engineering works that has a dynamometer.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Why is that you may ask? Because a prop is a very consistent, solid, no
 moving parts piece of machinery, whereas an engine wears out as the hours
 add up.
 This result is that less and less power is available to the propeller to
 convert engine power into usable thrust.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One can never, never-ever, expect the performance to be constant when one
 compares power output between a new engine and one that has done, say,
 200 hours on average.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
ENGINE PERFORMANCE 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Problems are normally caused by accrediting the engine with putting out
 more power than is actually the case.
 For example, the standard 1500VW, according to the manufacturers, gives
 45 bhp at 3800rpm.
 This is undoubtedly under ideal test-bed conditions, and the same engine,
 driving two magnetos and a tachometer at 3000rpm under less than ideal
 conditions is probably putting out less than 35 bhp.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Engine performance can enhance or destroy the performance of a propeller.
 A beautiful new out-of-the-box engine certainly has a lot of potential
 being new and all that, but consider that the engine still needs to be
 tuned and set up to produce maximum performance.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
More often than not you buy a new aircraft with a new engine or, if the
 aircraft is old and the original engine is beyond repair or salvaging,
 you decide to purchase a new engine.
 Maybe the original engine is still in good shape but several parts need
 replacement or the engine has many hours and only needs a service.
 All of the above factors contribute to the final power output at the prop
 end of the business.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
NEW ENGINES.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
New engines, be it on new or old aircraft, need to be adjusted and calibrated
 according to the manufacturers specification.
 Carburetor settings have to be done and the timing has to be re-calibrated
 to compensate for the height above sea-level that your specific aircraft
 is going to operate at for 80% of the time.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
RUNNING-IN PROCEDURES.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Running-in procedures have to be adhered to meticulously and the necessary
 hours flown to loosen up the pistons and overall mechanical working parts
 inside their various housings.
 Many a pilot I know of purchase a propeller, fits it to a new engine with
 zero hours on the hour meter, starts-up, and expects the power to be spot
 on the nose.
 This type of person is just begging for poor propeller performance and
 a subsequent out-landing.
 30 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even if the manufacturer of the aircraft or the person that has installed
 the engine has promised that the engine was test run or that the aircraft
 was test-flown, make sure that you have the correct jet size fitted to
 you're carburetor for the altitude that you are going to operate at.

\begin_layout Standard
OLD/USED ENGINES.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Should you buy a new prop for an aircraft that has several hours on the
 clock or should you be flying with an engine that is badly in need of a
 tune-up you can not expect the performance to be delivered to the propeller
 as stated by the manufacturer of the aircraft.
 Remember that propellers seldom, if ever, vary in power output at the driveshaf
t end.

WEATHER CONDITIONS.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you were a student at some or other flight academy one of the subjects
 that you had to study was meteorology.
 Meteorology concerns our weather patterns and the various influences there-on
 by several known factors.
 Two of these factors have a great influence on the performance of you're
 propeller.
 They are a) cool dry air and b) hot humid air.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
COOL DRY AIR.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Cool dry air is air that is cool and dry.
 Cool being normally below 21 degrees Celsius and dry meaning air with a
 relatively low water content (humidity).
 In this case the molecules of air are packed closely together with hardly
 any space between them to carry water molecules.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is an ideal situation for the aircraft, engine and propeller.
 Remember that all of the above factors contribute simultaneously to the
 performance of the craft.
 The thicker and tighter the air molecules are packed together the better
 will the craft climb and glide, the engine will run cooler and the propeller
 will have more of a solid grip on the air to pull
\backslash
thrust the whole dragging lot through the air.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This type of cool dry air is normally experienced in winter.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
HOT HUMID AIR.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hot humid air is air that is hot, normally more than 21 degrees Celsius
 and humid meaning air with a relatively high moisture content.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this case the molecules of air are spaced far apart due to the expansion
 of the air thus allowing water molecules to occupy the lift giving space
 that the air normally occupies.
 This is a less than ideal situation for the engine and propeller.
 The propeller has to seek one after the other air molecule in each revolution
 to gain enough energy to produce thrust! 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA TO REMEMBER THESE NOTES AT THIS STAGE.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The problem that will confront you at 2 o'clock in the afternoon, at 32
 degrees Celsius, with full fuel plus passenger, on a short landing strip
 will definitely be greater than the one you had getting into the strip,

 plus passenger.
 Suddenly the airstrip has shrunk!

DON'T YOU THINK IT IS RATHER OBVIOUS WHAT YOU SHOULD REGARD AS IMPORTANT???

\begin_layout Standard
FATIGUE.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fatigue.
 ...
 .the word has a dreadful, tiring sound to it.
 Images of being driven to the edge by a sadistic infantry P.T.I.
 flash through my mind.
 Remember those days when you where drilled on the parade ground for hours
 on end until your legs where rubbery, pliable and soft as JELLO with sweat
 burning your eyes while your tongue was hunting high and low caressing
 each nook and cranny of a dust fil led mouth cavity for a speck of moisture
 and your lungs where on fire, breaths coming in gasps? Yeaah.....the good old
 bad old days that most of us recovered from.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unlike your body which recovered fully and had adapted to the hardship in
 a process known as becoming "fit," a propeller does not have the same recuperat
ing and regenerative powers.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fatigue is found in all materials in every day life and is mostly caused
 by age or abuse.
 Propellers suffer from fatigue, even more so if it be a metal prop.
 Gyroscopic and torque forces working on a propeller exact a certain toll
 under any normal condition of flight, but is compounded rapidly should
 one abuse the propeller.
 But how does one abuse the prop? There are several factors involved i.e.
 the indifferent pilot who leaves his prop to the elements for years on
 end.
 This, however, is not the greatest of causes of fatigue.
 The biggest culprit is over-spinning.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
OVERSPINNING.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Overspinning means to spin a prop at constant excessively high revolutions
 for hours on end or at revolutions that exceed the design parameters of
 the manufacturer.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Spinning a prop at constant high excessive revolutions does not contribute
 greatly towards fatigue but the hours towards service or replacement of
 the propeller adds up rapidly.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The biggest culprit which induces rapid propeller fatigue to the point of
 in-flight failure is when a pilot enters a long dive, throttle up against
 the wall, engine screaming at maximum plus 20% revolutions, with the airspeed
 at 10% past VNE and, after he has soothed his ego, executes a rapid series
 of maneuvers.
 You wouldn't believe the forces that can develop in this situation.
 The blades may pass through the sound barrier.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Under normal circumstances a propeller works well at 800 to 900 kph tipspeed.
 The sound barrier lurks around the 1100kph mark.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Should the propeller be spun faster, the speed that the tips are traveling
 at in their helical flight path approaches and eventually encroaches on
 the sub-sonic barriers territory.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sub sonic barriers are stages of compressed air becoming denser and
 denser, starting off gradually but rapidly increasing in density.
 The tips of the propeller do not want to penetrate these layers of air
 and start to become "shy".
 They tend to shy away to the left or the right of their helical flight
 path.
 A good example is one of a reed standing in a river.
 As the flow of water increases the reed starts bending backwards.
 Unfortunately the reed does not only bend backwards but also moves from
 side to side as it is rooted to the river bed.
 The same thing happens to a propeller and is called oscillation.
 Unlike the reed in the river which oscillates slowly, a propeller may oscillate
 at a tremendous rate while trying to bend backwards, but is held back by
 the hub.
 Add to this scenario a large spoon of centrifugal forces and a huge helping
 of gyroscopic forces and one can imagine all the pushing, pulling, bumping
 and general shoving that is going on while the prop is spinning around
 the axis! 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our maniacal pilot, blissfully ignorant of the above facts, continues on
 his downward dive while the rpm gauge winds up and away.
 Eventually the tips of the propeller succeeds in penetrating the sub sonic
 barriers and now has to deal with the sound barrier in person.
 I am sure most pilots have seen a movie called "THE RIGHT STUFF".
 If you haven't seen it yet rush of to you're closest video shop and get
 it  ...
 .NOW! For those who have....Remember how the test pilot in the X-1 was banged
 and bounced around as his aircraft approached the mach one number? As soon
 as the craft had succeeded in penetrating the sound barrier there was a
 loud boom caused by the shock wave which follows when something "breaks"
 the barrier.
 The tips of the propeller experiences the same effect because it approaches
 the barrier slowly and eventually penetrates it.
 The tip speed continues to increase on the "other" side.....
\emph on
But the rest of the blade is still this side of the barrier ...
 in other words the barrier is sitting astride the leading edge of the propeller
, beating and bashing away and generally trying its level best to destroy
 this bothersome object that has dared to venture forth into its harsh domain.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A combination of all the above factors lead to fatigue in the hub area of
 the propeller.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
FATIGUE SIGNALS/SIGNS 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
VISUAL INSPECTION FOR: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As mentioned before a judicious pilot will do an after/pre-flight inspection
 of all parts of his aircraft including a thorough eyeball combined with
 a hands-on inspection of his propeller.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A sure sign of fatigue in a propeller are small cracks developing close
 to the hub area where the stresses are the greatest.
 An excellent indicator of fatigue is when you can see small cracks starting
 at the hub 
\emph on
on both blades
\emph default
.
 The cracks extend from the hub simultaneously in opposite directions and
 curve inwards towards the blades and, depending on the severity of the
 stress or fatigue, may vary in length from millimeters to a couple of centimete
rs.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It would be a good idea to point out that fatigue cracks should not be confused
 with delaminating of the wood laminates.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another sure sign of fatigue in wood props are small cracks extending from
 one bolt hole to another.
 The reasons for these type of cracks developing are usually bolt-holes
 that were drilled the same diameter as the bolt itself.
 Wood fibers tend to be combed in the direction that the drill bit is turning
 whilst the drilling process is in motion.
 As soon as the drill bit has left the hole these combed fibers expand thus
 narrowing the hole down to a smaller size than the drillbit.
 Should one insert a bolt into the hole one would feel a gliding action
 as the bolt slides down.
 Should you try to extract the bolt a couple of days later it stubbornly
 refuses to be moved at all! This happens because the wood fibers in the
 hole has taken a thorough grip on the bolt.
 The grip on the bolt becomes so tremendously strong that something has
 to give in the end...
 and it's usually the laminates between the bolt holes thus causing early
 fatigue in the hub area.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
DELAMINATING.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Delaminating is a dirty word in the propeller industry.
 One hears the word and conjures up visions of an aircraft plunging out
 of the sky whilst shedding pieces of airfoil propeller sections like a
 cat sheds hair in winter.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Delaminating of the laminates of the propeller may have various causes.
 The most likely are caused by exposure to the elements:- 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Ultra violet damage 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Water seepage 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Oil penetration 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Just as ultra violet rays from the sun does a great deal of damage to your
 skin it will surely strike your prop like a creeping cancer but, just like
 cancer, can be cured if you identify the symptoms before the natural fiber
 in the timber is destroyed.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Leaving your prop to the mercy of the elements will cause expensive and
 potentially dangerous damage to the exterior finish.
 As I often have a chance of visiting the various airfields around S.A.
 I sometimes wonder at the type of pilot who leaves his aircraft exposed
 to the harsh South African climate.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I would often walk up to a dusty bird parked outside a hangar and touch
 the propeller feeling very sad at the state of disrepair that it's in.
 Often the paint has started to peel along the trailing and leading edges
 and around the hub area leaving bare patches of exposed wood fiber.
 Sometimes the peeling would be so bad that the laminates are exposed to
 the direct beating of the sun.
 Since the paint work on a wood propeller is the first, last and only protection
 offered against the elements it becomes obvious what happens to the exposed
 timber.
 Just as any material under the sun expands and contracts due to the heat
 by day and the cold at night, timber is also susceptible to these factors
 with one exception, the timber dries out in the heat of the day and then
 sucks up the dew at night like a thirsty dog, only to lose it the next
 day only to soak up the moisture the night after, not to mention the rain
 storms that often follow a typically humid highveld day.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Wet, dry, cold, hot! A repetitive cycle slowly but powerfully applying expanding
 and contracting forces to the different laminates that make up the whole
 propeller.
 Is it any wonder that the timber or the adhesive should fail at some time?
 The timber loses it's natural colour, resilience and general luster and
 is replaced by a dull moldy greyish balsa-type wood with a tendency to
 turn into sawdust and rot as soon as one touches the bare surface.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I have yet to meet the pilot that, after he has done a couple of hours flying,
 takes out a soft cloth and wipes the oily two-stroke residue off his propeller.
 Every two-stroke engine does not burn up the oil that is mixed in the fuel
 100%.
 The unburned oil is blown out of the exhaust and more often than not is
 deposited onto the aerofoil-section of the propeller in thin layers.
 One does not tend to notice the build up until one touches the blade by
 accident and then draws back horrified at the sight of filthy oily fingers
 staring one in the face leaving one wondering "Now where in the devil did
 this come from?"

As sure as water is wet the oil deposit on your propeller will be affected
 by gravity, and will soon start a slow but sure migration downwards.
 In it's slow travels a small breach in the paintwork will definitely be
 found.
 Penetration is the name of the game and the nature of the beast.
 Soon black spots develop under the protective covering that the paintwork
 offers.
 Having excellent lifting and freeing capabilities, the oil starts to lift
 the paintwork in small bubbles.
 But wait!, not only does it have action in one direction, but also begins
 to penetrate the

 Soon the creeping destroyer comes upon the adhesive layer that holds one

 These spray cleaners tend to build up a layer of wax which in turn will
 make your propeller unbalanced and very difficult to service later on as
 the new layer of paint that will be applied will not adhere solidly to
 the surface of the blades.
 You will definitely have to cough up for the extra hours in labor should
 the manufacturer have to remove all the paintwork and rebuild the protective

do.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First of all it is up to you to see that no oil accumulates on the surface
 of the blades.
 Wipe the blades regularly with a clean roller

towel or soft cloth.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Secondly inspect the leading and trailing edges for small breaches in the
 paintwork.
 Should you feel and see small pockmarks combined with a sandpaper effect
 on the blades it may be necessary to remove the prop from the engine and
 send it in for a service.
 Do not attempt to sand the paint down as the chances that you will change
 or damage the airfoil of the blades are excellent.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Small dents (5mm or less) may be filled with a reputable epoxy normally
 of the clear type.

\begin_layout Section
TO CUT OR NOT TO CUT, THAT IS THE QUESTION.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I've given the following section a lot of thought before writing it.
 Let me warn you beforehand that what you are about to read and attempt
 may leave your prop utterly useless and beyond salvation.
 I will accept no responsibility of whatever nature for the results that
 you may obtain after having read this section.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sometimes, but fortunately not often, you need to shorten the propeller
 to suite the particular needs of the aircraft.
 You have to make a very important decision.
 Once a prop has been cut..., that's it..., you can't put back what is lost.
 If, for some reason the prop is underreving, then it may be that the prop
 is too long or has too much blade area for the engine to handle.
 What can you do about it? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are four courses of action you can take:- 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1) RETURN THE PROP TO THE MANUFACTURER accompanied by the relevant information
 relating to what the propeller is doing at present and ask them to adjust
 it.
 SOMETIMES THEY CAN, SOMETIMES THEY CAN'T.
 Again it depends if the prop was originally designed for your specific
 engine/aircraft combination.
 DO MAKE SURE OF THE FACTS.
 Nobody on this earth can say "I CAN HEAR THAT THE PROP IS UNDER/OVERREVING".
 Maybe that's true, but the manufacturer is going to ask you a couple of
 awkward questions and you better have the facts ready.
 Following is an example of some of the questions you may be asked:- 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
BY HOW MUCH IS IT OVER/UNDER REVVING EXACTLY (TO THE NEAREST 50 RPM?).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
STATIONARY OR ON THE MOVE? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
IF ON THE MOVE, AT WHAT SPEED? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
AT ROTATION, CLIMB-OUT, CRUISE OR MAX.
 S&L?.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
2) YOU MAY SHORTEN THE PROP.
 A bit dicey for the inexperienced, but you may remove half-an-inch from
 each side without altering the characteristics dramatically.
 Remember to paint the bare wood with a good two-part acrylic epoxy paint
 to stop moisture from penetrating the wood.
 You will also have to check the balance again by applying a small amount
 of aerosol clear lacquer to the side that is heavier.
 Remember to let the spray dry completely.
 The reason being that the lacquer thinners in the spray needs to evaporate
 completely.
 If the prop is balanced while wet with paint, it will give you a false
 reading.
 Double so if you balance it by applying a large amount of acrylic paint
 to the tips.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
3) YOU MAY NARROW THE BLADE by removing 2mm from the trailing edge.
 By this method you keep the length of the prop (which is very important),
 but you subtract from the total blade area so the engine has to move less
 air).
 HOWEVER, I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT THIS IS THE RISKIEST MOVE OF ALL.
 IT MEANS THAT YOU WILL HAVE TO RE-SHAPE THE AIRFOIL SECTION BECAUSE THE
 TRAILING EDGE WILL BE BULKY AND INEFFICIENT.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
33 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
4) YOU MIGHT CHANGE THE PITCH.
 VERY IMPORTANT! If you are one of the 1% nutty flyers out there....READ ON,
 but I shudder to think of the results you will get.
 Having made over 2500 propellers in 18 years I have yet to see a successful
 attempt at altering the pitch of a wood prop.
 Theoretically the idea is magnificent, but practically.
 ...
 .???? Should you decide on the latter...GIVE ME A CALL.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
4a) INCREASING THE PITCH.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is only possible if the blade section has sufficient initial thickness
 so that the removal of wood from the underside of the leading edge does
 not make it structurally defective.
 The new blade angles should be checked blade to blade and the prop refurbished
 and balanced.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Only the outer 50% of the blades should be altered unless the prop is of
 a particular thick section to start with.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
4b) DECREASING THE PITCH.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This may be done in two ways.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Method one is to trim the blade trailing edges back to the required thickness
 and then remove material from the back face of the blades to form the new
 angle, finishing and balancing as before Method two is suitable when more
 pitch change is required.
 The rear faces of the blades are cleaned off and a thin plank is glued
 on.
 The lower leading edge may have to be reshaped slightly.
 This method should be confined to the outer 50% of each blade unless structural
 requirements allow otherwise.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In all of the above cases you should re-check your readings all over again
 from the beginning.
 Don't take a guess of what the prop will do, and then cut 10 inches off
 the tip!

 AN AIRCRAFT THROUGH CLEAN, CLEAR AIR....

 KIT.! 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are various types of leading edge protection available throughout
 the world.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The idea of leading edge protection arrived 3 minutes after the WRIGHT brothers
 got their first blast of sand going through the propeller.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using the knowledge of the day they devised a method of gluing some material
 along the leading edge but soon found that IRISH linen hardly protects
 the painted surface of the wood and so something better and durable had
 to be found that would stick to the surface of the blades without hindering
 the propeller performance or altering the characteristics of the blades.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Various materials with various methods of application were tried but all
 was found wanting in some sort of aspect or another.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fiberglass and composites was yet to be explored and utilized to the advantage
 of protection.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Metal edging seemed to be the answer and, for the lack of something better,
 was applied for years and years.
 Wood is a natural fiber and thus susceptible to natures decomposing techniques.
 The biggest problem encountered is the ability of water to penetrate most
 types of leading edge protection purely through the fact that all types
 of edges that serve only as a covering over the wood will be breached at
 some or another stage.
 The result was that manufactures built up layers of protection starting
 of with a base coat of a rubber compound then applied a matrix of woven
 copper then covered the whole lot with sections of brass, copper or steel
 which was riveted to the leading edge.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This was a useless exercise because the holes that were drilled through
 the metal edge, the woven copper mat and the rubber served to channel the
 water directly to the wood underneath.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The result was that the manufacturers then put a final coat of material
 i.e.
 fiberglass over the leading edge followed by numerous thick coats of paint.
 The next problem that arose and stared everybody in the face was the bulky
 appearance that the propeller took on after all the various applications
 of the various materials was done.
 A certain amount of weight was gained as well which in turn made the propeller
 heavy and so contributed to excessive gyroscopic forces and so the engine
 bearings had to be strengthened and so the story carries on and on.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The characteristics of some designs were altered to such an extent that
 some propellers became useless after the leading edge protection was applied.
 A sad state of affairs indeed but alas what could one do except develop
 a complete metal propeller? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
------- oOo ------ 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
DISEASES OF LEADING EDGE PROTECTION 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Any breach in the leading edge of a propeller immediately becomes a potential
 victim of leading edge disease ranging from dry rot to wet rot to edging
 that loses grip to rivets that become loose or wood that cracks around
 the rivet holes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
FIBERGLASS PROTECTION AND DISEASE 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In their quest for a better leading edge protector manufacturers of propellers
 tried and tested various compounds ranging from the unbelievable to the
 most ridiculous compound imaginable.
 A good example is one where a well known pilot and instructor melted a
 2litre plastic COKE bottle and then poured the mess over the leading edge
 shaping it with a flat iron so that it resembled the airfoil to a more
 or lesser extent.
 Suffice to say that it did not do the job.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As soon as manufacturers heard of the excellent water protective qualities
 that fiberglass and resin had to offer everyone jumped on the bandwagon
 and tons and tons of fiberglass was deftly and feverishly applied to hundreds
 and hundreds of propellers.
 What they did not realize was that fiberglass did not have the brute strength
 of metal edging nor the resilience of a rubber or urethane compound.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fiberglass, when applied to a propeller, helps strengthen the natural fibers
 and stiffness of the wood, but has the disadvantage of being extremely
 difficult to apply evenly over the shape of the propeller due to the constant
 curving and twisting of the propeller.
 Secondly it has the disadvantage of adding dead unneeded weight to the
 prop.
 Thirdly, if the layers of fiberglass and resin has any air bubbles trapped
 they will be exposed as pin holes in the final sanding and balancing process.
 It is also extremely difficult to apply the fiberglass and resin evenly
 without disturbing the balance of the propeller to a great extent.
 The balance of the propeller may be so far out that a great amount of sanding
 will have to be done exposing the fibers and thus you would have to apply
 another coat of resin, disturbing the balance once again which leads to
 another sanding job and so ending with the propeller either being rendered
 useless or being so heavy and bulky that the engine would have to double
 its power output to turn it.
 The airfoil section will definitely be altered and the theoretical angel
 of attack on the flat side of the blade will be altered as well.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Serving as a protective layer over the leading edge of the propeller fiberglass
 
\emph on
and
\emph default
 carbon fiber fails dismally, as well as various other types of metal edgings.
 The constant attack of water and sand and sometimes a combination of both
 these factors will erode the edge severely.
 As the layer of resin and glass is stripped away the remaining glass is
 exposed to a 820 kph.
 fantastically turbulent wind.
 These are stripped away very rapidly, sometimes ripping out pieces of propeller
 with it.
 This may lead to rapid failure of the integrity of the prop leading to
 a rapid and explosive set of events.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I have yet to see a successful application of fiberglass and resin on a
 propeller that has seen 50 hours of rough terrain operating conditions!
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
METAL EDGE PROTECTION DISEASE 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Any type of metal edging that was ever designed only protects the wood beneath
 as long as the protection is not breached.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unfortunately it happens and thus the wood comes under attack from various
 types of disease.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A metal edge that is made up of sections rather than one continuous strip
 is more susceptible to attack from water than other types of edging.
 As soon as the paintwork over the metal is breached water and oil will
 penetrate the space and eventually penetrate the wood underneath the edging.
 As soon as one of these elements penetrate the wood beneath the edging
 it starts to fill the dry wooden cells which causes them to expand tremendously.
 The water seeps in between the rivet shaft and the wall of the wood putting
 pressure on the hole.
 The hole expands, the metal will not compress, so the result is that the
 wood will crack around the rivet AND beneath the edging were one can not
 notice it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second disease that attacks propellers with a metal edge is dry/wet
 rot.
 Since water has penetrated the wood fibers and cells there are various
 fungi spores that will follow the same path as the water has.
 As soon as there is a humid environment fungi will grow as sure as mushrooms
 in dark dank humid places do.
 Once the fungi has established its presence it begins to consume the fiber
 and decompose the structure of the cells.
 All of this may happen over a time span of 3 weeks to 3 years depending
 on the seriousness of the breach in the protection.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
SYMPTOMS OF LEADING EDGE DISEASE 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The symptoms of leading edge disease are easily recognizable.
 A black, gray or green discoloring of the wood indicates that something
 has penetrated the fiber.
 If there are any sections of metal that feel lax or free or any rivets
 that are moving it is time to have the propeller serviced.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
WARNING: Any changes that are made to your blades will drastically affect
 the performance of the propeller up to a point were it becomes hazardous
 to downright dangerous to operate.
 Please do not attempt major repair work even if it looks like a small job!

THE TEN COMMANDMENTS OF PROP CARE 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1.
 Thou shalt never force a prop to fit 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you get your new prop don't drive it onto the engine flange.
 Always make sure that the holes are the right size.
 the bolt holes should fit snugly.
 Whatever you do don't knock it on with a hammer or pry it loose with a
 screwdriver.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
2.
 Thou shalt keep an absolutely tidy and clean prop and engine flange.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the backplate and flange aren't clean and smooth your prop will be pushed
 out of track.
 Some people paint their backplates without giving it another thought.
 Don't do it.
 When you take the prop off for repair or replacement, some paint, even
 a few minor flecks, may stick to the flange.
 If left there, that's all it will take to throw the tracking off.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
3.
 Thou shalt mate a full size crush plate to thy prop hub.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You should have a full size crush plate, which becomes a bearing surface
 for the prop, and wide area washers under your bolt heads because it puts
 the load on the whole diameter of the hub.
 Wide area washers distribute the load better over the crush plate too.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
4.
 Thou shalt torque the bolts properly.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Make sure you know the torque on the bolts.
 Carelessness here may lead to a nasty Judgment Day: Namely, the prop might
 fly right off the engine.
 It's been known to happen and over-tightening is the culprit.
 That's because today's improved wood technology means that new props can
 withstand many more pounds torque than they used to.
 That may mean more pounds of torque than the bolts can handle.
 Many people don't realize that you can easily overtighten your bolts and
 seriously decrease their effective strength.
 If you us off-brand bolts, you can't depend on those torquing values because
 they are made in an uncontrolled environment.
 Always use AN hardware.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Don't attempt to tighten bolts without a torque wrench.
 Guessing at values with a regular ratched or monkey wrench is just another
 form of Russian roulette----and you are guaranteed to lose.
 Torquing properly includes cross tightening.
 This refers to the sequence of tightening down the bolts.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For further reference read the chapter on fitting the propeller to the hub.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
5.
 Thou shalt track the prop to maximum performance.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An out of track prop will add unwanted vibration to your ship.
 Refer to the previous chapter in the "tracking" section for further detail
 on tracking your propeller.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
6.
 Thou shalt help thy prop do battle against sun, weather and moisture migration.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
UV is one of the major sources of damage to a wood prop.
 Most aircraft are kept inside, but I recommend a prop cover whenever the
 plane is outside.
 All wood has moisture and P.PROP blanks have an 8 to 10% moisture content
 on an average day.
 Regular wood, Birch or Beech can run as high as 12%.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Never stand a prop up in a corner, not even for a day! If you do, stand
 it on the other tip for a day.
 If you do for any length of time the prop will go permanently out of balance.
 Keep it laying on a floor.
 Protect the prop from temperature extremes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
7.
 Thou shalt keep thy prop clean.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The slicker the prop, the less likely it is to take hits.
 A smooth clean surface will keep the air more laminar on the prop.
 This in turn will build up an air cushion that will help protect the wood
 against damage from rocks and smell debris.
 It wont deflect a brick, but it can make a difference in the repairs that
 will have to be made when you pick up some dirt or gravel at the next dirt
 airstrip.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
8.
 Thou shalt ground thy craft rather than fly with even a slightly damaged
 propeller.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you do get damage take a two part glue or epoxy and seal it.
 It's important to visualize that any dent or disturbance in the prop will
 set up as much as a 30 degree fan or wake of turbulence behind it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
9.
 Thou shalt routinely inspect thy prop for signs of dry rot.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If your prop develops gray spots then it is the beginning of dry rot, which
 is moisture getting into the wood.
 There is a break in the finish somewhere.
 If you find it early enough to save the prop, sand it out.
 The prop can then be repaired to a like-new condition.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
10.
 Thou shalt keep the faith with a damaged prop.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Small dings wont make much difference in balance.
 But for a major ding, a prop shop can often salvage a prop by laminating
 in a layer of wood, or several if necessary, to make a strong and thorough
 repair.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I have had leading and trailing edges with 75mm to 100mm missing out of
 them.
 With the new techniques and materials available today, I can repair them
 good as new.
 The only thing you can't repair is the tip itself.
 The centrifugal loads are to high.
 If the tip is dinged or bashed that's the end of it.
 The tip must be intact.
 Within 25mm from the tip some fantastic repairs can be done.

\begin_layout Standard
DO...SWEEP THE FIRST 20M OF YOUR RUNWAY REGULARLY.
 While you are standing around shooting the bull with your fellow aviators,

FINALLY 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Periodically, you should send in your prop to have it re-balanced or re-manufact
ured.
 P.PROP completely strips it down to the bare wood.
 Once down to the bare wood it is sanded, the pitches are checked and it's
 run through the whole finishing process exact ly like a new prop.
 If there have been any updates or improvements in the design since you
 bought it, those are put in, too, if possible.

\begin_layout Standard
In closing, one last word in defence of this one major airplane element
 that is taken much to much for granted:- 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
The propeller is one of the three major components of any aircraft, side
 by side with the airframe and engine.
 Pilots worry a lot about load and stress factors, performance, things like
 that, but props and their correct installation and maintenance are vitally
 important to your flying safety and enjoyment.

DEFINITIONS AND TERMS 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Aerodynamics: That branch of dynamics that deals with the relative motion
 between air and objects in it and the reactions created by those interactions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Aerodynamic force: Any force generated by the relative motion of air upon
 a body immersed in it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Air: A mixture of the various gasses that compose the earth's atmosphere.
 Its main ingredients include 21% oxygen and 78% nitrogen, plus a mixture
 of inert gasses.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Aircraft: The term applies to any and all vehicles of the air.
 It includes any man-made structure, machine , designed to be supported
 by the air either by dynamic reactions with the air or by its own buoyancy
 in the air.
 In its most general meaning, the term aircraft applies to fixed wing airplanes,
 flexible wing airplanes and hang gliders, helicopters, sailplanes, free
 and tethered balloons, blimps, dirigibles, ornithopters, flying model aircraft,
 kites and ground effect machines.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Airflow: Motion of a stream of air.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Airfoil: Any structure, such as a propeller blade or wing, around which
 air flows to provide a reaction useful for flight.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Airspeed: The speed with which an aircraft moves relative to the air.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Airworthy propeller: A propeller in condition for safe flight.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Aviation: The art of flying by mechanical means, especially with airplanes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Blade: One "wing" of a propeller.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Blade area: The area or "size" of both blades.
 The area is determined by the engine power.
 A certain area is needed for a certain engine to absorb the power available
 and convert it to usable thrust.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Blade chord: The width of an aerodynamic surface, such as the length of
 a propeller from leading edge to trailing edge.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Camber: The curvature of an airfoil, expressed as a percentage of its chord.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Composite: Generally referring to construction.
 It primarily connotes a foam core fiberglass sandwich, although any structure
 that uti lizes more than one type of material could be considered a composite
 structure.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Cruise speed: The speed normally flown, which is below top speed, for cross
 country flight because of economic and engine life reasons.
 It is generally quoted as that speed which occurs at a power setting between
 65% - 75% of maximum engine power.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Drag: The total aerodynamic force tending to retard an aircraft's motion
 through the air.
 It is made up of induced drag, parasitic drag and profile drag components.
 Thrust is required to overcome drag.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Drive-shaft: An extension shaft connecting the engine to the prop flange.
 Mostly used where the engine is situated on top of, or below the wing or
 in the mid section of the fuselage 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Direct drive: The propeller is driven directly by the engine.
 The propeller is fitted to the extension of the crankshaft by means of
 a flange as is the case in most V.W.
 engine powered aircraft.
 The propeller rotates in the same direction as the engine.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Empty weight: The weight of an unoccupied and unloaded aircraft, including:
 hydraulic fluid, engine coolant, undrainable oil, unusable fuel and any
 attached ballast weights.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fixed-pitch propeller: A propeller with blades not adjustable in flight.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Flutter: A harmonic vibration or oscillation induced by aerodynamic forces
 on a propeller blade.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Gearbox-drive: A drive where various gears in various ratios are used to
 reduce the r.p.m.
 of the propeller to suite the requirements of the aircraft.
 The propeller rotates in the opposite direction to the engine.
 Mostly used on microlight aircraft but also found in the amateur-built
 section.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ground adjustable propeller: A propeller with blades adjustable on the ground.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
37 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hub: The center section of a propeller.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Induced drag: Drag due to lift.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Laminar flow: Airflow in which there is no intermixing of streamlines.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Maneuver speed: The highest safe speed for abrupt maneuvers or for very
 rough air.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Minimum flying speed: The lowest airspeed at which an aircraft can maintain
 altitude out of ground effect.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parasite drag: Drag caused by all none lifting parts of an aircraft.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Propeller pitch: The theoretical distance a propeller moves forward with
 each revolution.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Rate of climb: The vertical speed, or speed at which an aircraft gains altitude,
 usually quoted in feet per minute at sea level air density 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Reduction drive: Belt-driven or gearbox.
 The idea is to slow the prop r.p.m.
 down so that a longer and more efficient propeller may be fitted to the
 aircraft engine 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sink rate: The vertical speed at which an aircraft descends in still air.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Span: The length of a propeller from tip to tip 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thrust: The motive force provided by an airplane propeller in overcoming
 the drag.
 As the propeller rotates an airflow passes over the blades in the opposite
 direction in exactly the same way as an airflow passes over the wing.
 The blade is inclined at an angle to this airflow and so obtains a re-action
 from it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thrust line: The imaginary line through which the thrust acts.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Torque: Torque is the resistance of a propeller to rotation.
 It has a considerable effect on the aircraft in various conditions of flight,
 because the resistance of the propeller to rotation tends to turn the aircraft
 the opposite way 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Turbulence: Rough air caused by streamlines mixing together.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Variable-pitch propeller: A propeller whose angle can be adjusted in flight.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Vortices: A twisting air motion occurring primarily at proptips.
 They are caused by the pressure difference that exist between the upper
 and lower surfaces of a prop.
 The air spills out from under the wing and curls over to the lower pressure
 surface.
 The strength of such vortices depends on a propeller's tip shape and aspect
 ratio.
 If stationary, a prop tip vortices may be able to "suck" in a golf ball
 sized object 200mm high 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Windmilling: A propeller turning from a reaction with the relative wind
 and not by ithe engine.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Wash: The airflow field behind a propeller, created by the propeller as
 it passes through the atmosphere
